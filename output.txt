Science is a major force in the introduction of new ideas and information in society. This
has not always been so. After a hesitant beginning in the high middle ages, science deﬁ-
nitely took off during the late Renaissance as a competing force with religion and began to
capture the hearts and minds of many people.While originally motivated by the desire to
know life, how it originated, and how it could be extended, science was soon absorbed by
the prosaicism of the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
From then on science was subject to practical purposes such as industrial manufacture,
environmental control, and ﬁghting human disease. As such, science was generally
accepted by the general population.
Meanwhile, the quest for the origin of life, of who we are, how we live, and how we die
never expired and eventually resulted in a remarkably clear picture that is now generally
adopted by the more enlightened in society. Ironically, this insight is highly controversial
in society as a whole and not accepted at all by a large fraction (probably the vast major-
ity) of the world population. Indeed, Darwin is as controversial now as in the nineteenth
century.Meanwhile,biology has come to dominate the science of the twenty-ﬁrst century
and it is no wonder that again,as in the seventeenth century,it is the limit to life that takes
hold of the minds of many of our best thinkers. To some extent we have come full circle.
The question is again whether we can beat the aging process and disassemble the road-
blocks to immortality, this time through the accomplishments of the new biology. Can
modern science succeed where hermeticism failed?
To know whether it is possible to prevent or cure aging we need to know what it is that
makes us lose our vigor, causes disease, and ﬁnally, inescapably, leads to death. This book
is a recapitulation of one of the oldest and arguably the most consistent theories of how
we age. First formulated in the 1950s, the somatic mutation theory explains aging as a
gradual accumulation of random alterations in the DNA of the genome in the cells of our
body. This theory has proved to be remarkably robust and is compatible with the other
major theory of aging that does not die: the free-radical theory of aging.Whereas the latter
provides a logical explanation for where most of life’s wear and tear comes from, the
somatic mutation theory explains how this can result in physiological decline and increased
disease. Or does it?
Based on what we now know about the genome, ours as well as those of many other
species,how the information it contains is maintained as part of its structural characteris-
tics,and how this information is retrieved and translated into function,is it still reasonable

to see this as the main cause of aging in a time when most of us are convinced that the process
is multifactorial and must have many causes? Is it possible that the inherent instability of
our genomes is not only responsible for the increased chance of getting cancer in old age,
but also in some way has an adverse effect on cell function, results in reduced organ
capacity, and causes a variety of physiological changes, as well as such diseases as cardio-
vascular disease,neurodegenerative disorders,and diabetes? Finally,what are the implica-
tions of such a stochastic, molecular basis of aging for all those strategies that are now
being designed to keep us alive and healthy a bit longer and possibly forever? This and
more will be discussed

Introduction: the coming of 
age of the genome
Science and technology extend life and improve the quality of life.Whereas in a sense this
may have been true since the origin of Homo sapiens, it has never been more apparent
than after the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, when great strides in
physics, chemistry and medicine signiﬁcantly improved life for rich and poor alike. By
1900 most European countries had been liberated from the danger of recurrent famine.
In addition,improved sanitary conditions,vaccination,and the widespread availability of
antibiotics have been responsible for the dramatic increase in average lifespan over the
last 200 years.Most of this increase in lifespan has been due to the rapid decrease in infant
mortality,since the lives of babies and young children are especially precarious in times of
hunger and disease, the latter usually following the former. However, evidence is now
emerging that since the 1970s, possibly due to greater awareness of adverse lifestyle
habits—such as smoking—and more effective medical care, mortality and morbidity of
the elderly has been rapidly declining (at least in developed countries)1,2. In Sweden, a
highly developed country with reliable demographic data on human lifespan since 1861,
maximum age at death has risen from about 101 years during the 1860s to about 108 years
during the 1990s, suggesting that the maximum lifespan of humans and possibly other
animals is not immutable3.
Whereas average lifespan is deduced from the age at death of all individuals of a popu-
lation, including those who die very early, maximum lifespan is the maximum attainable
duration of life for an individual of a given species. In principle, therefore, the maximum
lifespan of our species is the age at death of the longest-lived human, which is 122 years.
Jeanne Calment,a French woman who attained this respectable age,died in 1997.A better
measure of the trend in achieved human lifespan is the change in upper percentiles of the
age distribution of deaths, as was used in the study on maximum lifespan in Sweden cited
above. In June 2006 the longest living human was Maria Esther Capovilla from Ecuador,
who was then 116 years old. Before her, several human so-called supercentenarians died
in quick succession around this age, underscoring the limitations of our species-speciﬁc
genetic make-up in keeping us alive over extended periods of time. Further optimization
in the way we live, even with the best possible medical care, will not appreciably change
that situation. Under these ideal conditions, lifespan will likely continue to increase, but
slowly and gradually. However, what will happen if science is able to alter the way we are,
rather than the way we live? Will the recent dramatic developments in the biological

sciences free us from the bonds, which, as in any other species, ﬁx the time of our lives?
Is biology crossing a threshold, from a strictly intellectual exercise in understanding life,
to an orchestrated effort to halt its demise? Most importantly, can such an effort succeed
or are there some inherent mechanistic limitations,which will ultimately prevent us from
rapidly achieving, say, a doubling of human lifespan? As I will try to argue in this book,
the answers to these questions may be hidden in the genome. The rapid rise of modern
biology is very much the story of the coming of age of the genome, the complete set of
genetic information of an organism. Genome research has not only provided us with our
current basic understanding of the logic of life, but has also supplied the tools to practice
a whole new form of biomedicine, now termed genomic medicine. It is the genome as a
ﬂuid entity that bears witness to the history of life as it has unfolded on our planet since
the ﬁrst replicators.It is the genome that carries the seeds of our development from fertil-
ized egg into maturity.And it may be the genome, with its inherent instability, that will be
responsible for our ultimate demise.
In this ﬁrst chapter I will sketch the major developments in the science of biology,from
the Renaissance to the genome revolution, in two parallel lines: one that explains how we
gradually gained a mechanistic understanding of how life perpetuates itself through ran-
dom alterations in DNA, with aging of its carriers as the inevitable by-product, and a
much more complicated learning curve that thus far has merely provided the starting
points of how we hope to gain a more complete understanding of how life forms are
ordered at the molecular level and how this order turns into disorder during aging.
1.1 The age of biology
With physics and chemistry at their zenith in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
biology, the study of life, is often considered the premier science of the century we have
just entered, with the promise to revolutionize human existence. The information explo-
sion in biology,which started relatively late,will soon reach a stage when,for the ﬁrst time
in human history,we might be able to extend and improve our life in a more fundamental
way than through manipulation of our environment or lifestyle; that is, by intervening in
our basic biological circuits in a way that will allow us to break the constraints of our
species-speciﬁc genetic make-up. To reach this stage, biology has evolved from an origi-
nally descriptive science,through a period of hypothesis-driven experimental research,to
the data-driven era, which we have now entered, with the prospect of rational interven-
tions based on in silico models that can provide an integrated understanding of the
processes that give and maintain human life.
At the dawn of modern biology two major, often intertwined, branches of knowledge-
gathering sprung from the same source: the invention of the microscope in the new
2
INTRODUCTION

permissive era of the Renaissance, which allowed for the ﬁrst time a detailed observation
of the various manifestations of life. A dual quest began to discover life in all its splendid
variability and to ﬁnd out the details of its workings. Along these parallel paths of study-
ing why life is and how it works, the science of aging emerged from the why and how of
life’s natural limitation, observed in so many of its individual representatives (see
Timeline, p. xi).
1.1.1 THE LOGIC OF LIFE
The question of life’s origin and its perpetuation in such a wide variety of forms appeared
to be the most challenging of questions and was tackled in successive stages by a number
of great minds from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries. This quest culminated
in Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and Watson and Crick’s discovery of
the molecular structure of DNA. The grand understanding of the logic of life would
prove equally important for understanding its demise: the logic of aging.
Before the seventeenth century our state of knowledge was static and, in Western
Europe, mainly based on a synthesis of the Greek–Roman heritage and the Christian
Church. Following Aristotle (384–322 BC) the general consensus at the beginning of our
modern era was that small animals like ﬂies and worms originated spontaneously from
putrefying matter. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) was one of the ﬁrst to dis-
credit this popular notion of spontaneous generation, based on his direct observations
of bacteria, protists, and living sperm cells with home-made microscopes—an early
example of technology driving progress in biology. After examining and describing the
spermatozoa from mollusks, ﬁsh, amphibians, birds, and mammals, he came to the novel
conclusion that fertilization occurred when the spermatozoa penetrated the egg.
Having reached the consensus that life begets life an explanation was sought for the
bewildering variation of life forms on earth. Aristotle had provided the world with a
grand biological synthesis, including a classiﬁcation of animals grouped together in gen-
era and species. He was of the opinion that the current biological diversity had existed
from the start, which was later adopted by the church in the form of the dogma that all
creatures were created independently of one another by God and organized into a hierar-
chy. It was Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) who provided us with a system for naming, rank-
ing, and classifying organisms, still in wide use today, which would become the ultimate
tool for recognizing the logic of a system of evolutionary descent. Initially, Linnaeus
believed that species weres unchangeable, and he never abandoned the concept of a pre-
ordained diversity of life forms. But Linnaeus observed how different plant species could
hybridize to create forms which looked like new species. He abandoned the concept that
species were ﬁxed and invariable, and suggested that some—perhaps most—species in a
genus might have arisen after the creation of the world, through hybridization4.

Alfred Wallace (1823–1913) and Charles Darwin (1809–1882), then, provided the
now generally accepted explanation for the intriguing similarities among organisms, so
beautifully organized by the system of Linnaeus.Whereas the different species had gener-
ally been assumed to be immutable and stable since the era of Plato and Aristotle,Darwin
had begun to see life as ﬂuid, and recognized that ample variation was present, even
among individuals of the same population. Like several scientists before him, Darwin
had come to believe that all life on Earth evolved (developed gradually) over millions of
years from a few common ancestors. However, the primary mechanism of this process
of evolutionary descent was unknown. Based on careful observations of many variations
among plants and animals on the Galapagos Islands and South America during a British
science expedition around the world, he proposed a process of natural selection to
advance certain characteristics best adapted to environmental conditions. The results of
this work were published as On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the
Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (1859), commonly referred to as
The Origin of Species5.
Evolution by natural selection was controversial from the beginning and is still less
generally accepted than, for example, Einstein’s theories of relativity. This already indi-
cates the sensitivity of society to new concepts in biology involving humans and our
position in the living world. The original criticisms of evolutionary descent focused
on the need to accept that current life, among which the human species was only one tip
on a branching tree, extended back through ancestral species over a time period much
longer than the biblical 6000 years. However, the most serious problem, still the main
hindrance today for many people to accept Darwin’s theory, is the lack of purpose and
direction that speaks from his explanation of life. Natural selection makes use of existing,
natural differences among individuals in a population of a species in their suitability to
adapt to special problems in their local environment.We now know that such differences
in heritable traits continually arise in our germ cells by random changes in the genes
that control those traits. Individuals less ﬁt in a given environment are eliminated,
whereas those with the most favorable traits leave a disproportionately high number of
offspring.As recognized by the great evolutionist Ernst Mayr (1904–2005), the process of
adaptation to special problems of local environments gives rise to new species when frag-
ments of a population become geographically and reproductively isolated; this is known
as allopatric speciation. (Other, less well explored mechanisms of speciation may also
operate.)
The concept of open-ended evolution, not necessarily governed by a Divine Plan and
with no predetermined goal,is still unaccepted by many.Confusion and resistance to new
scientiﬁc discoveries are not uncommon, as exempliﬁed by popular reactions to
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle and Freud’s revelations of the subconscious at the
beginning of the twentieth century. However, the alarm felt by many when confronted
with the implications of Darwin’s theory regarding the position of humans in life as a
4

whole are quite unique. Indeed, the validity of the physical principles underlying the
automobile, air travel, and the personal computer are never doubted by the general
public. By contrast, equally solid principles in biology are often rejected out of hand
by sizable segments of the educated public based on the strong intuitive appeal—
often inspired by religion—of intelligent design and purposeful direction. Biology will
continue to raise feelings of uneasiness in the years to come.
After Darwin, the next major development in biology was the emergence of the con-
cept of the gene. A problem with Darwin’s theory of natural selection as the mechanism
of evolutionary change was the lack of knowledge as to how random variations in herita-
ble traits could arise and how they could be perpetuated from parents to offspring.
Ironically, the genetic principles governing this latter process had already been described
in Darwin’s lifetime by the Czech monk, Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). Working with
different kinds of peas, Mendel demonstrated that the appearance of different hereditary
traits followed speciﬁc laws, which could be understood by counting the diverse kinds
of offspring produced from particular sets of parents. He established two principles
of heredity that are now known as the law of segregation and the law of independent
assortment, thereby proving the existence of paired elementary units of heredity (which
he called factors) and establishing the statistical laws governing them. Mendel’s ﬁndings
on plant hybridization were ignored until they were conﬁrmed independently in 1900 by
three botanists.
After 1900, the physical basis for Mendel’s laws was discovered in the form of the chro-
mosomal basis for the transmission of genes from parents to offspring. Thomas Hunt
Morgan (1866–1945) was the ﬁrst to provide conclusive evidence that chromosomes are
the location of Mendel’s factors, termed genes by Wilhelm Johanssen in 1907 (in Greek
meaning ‘to give birth to’). Morgan chose the fruit ﬂy, Drosophila melanogaster, as his
experimental animal, which has remained a key experimental model system in genetics
ever since. In 1910, he found a mutant male ﬂy with white rather than the normal red
eyes. Since all the female ﬂies had red eyes with only some males having white eyes,
Morgan realized that white eye color is not only a recessive trait but is also linked in some
way to sex. This work led to the identiﬁcation of four so-called linkage groups, which
correlated nicely with the four pairs of chromosomes that Drosophila was known to pos-
sess. Their subsequent breeding experiments provided proof that the chromosomes are
indeed the bearers of the genes, with different genes having speciﬁc locations along
speciﬁc chromosomes. Traits on one particular chromosome naturally tended to segre-
gate together. However, Morgan noted that these ‘linked’ traits would separate, from
which he inferred the process of chromosome recombination: two paired chromosomes
could exchange genetic material between each other, an event termed crossover. The fre-
quency of recombination appeared to be a function of the distance between genes on the
chromosome. The smaller that distance, the greater their chance of being inherited
together, whereas the farther away they are from each other, the more chance of their

being separated by the process of crossing over. The Morgan is now the unit of measure-
ment of distances along all chromosomes in ﬂy, mouse, and human.
In the meantime, cytologists had described the processes of mitosis and meiosis at the
end of the nineteenth century. The chromosomes, thread-shaped structures under the
microscope, were known to be located in the nucleus of a cell, but nobody knew their
function. By correlating their breeding results with cytological observations of chromo-
somes, Morgan’s group provided the physical reality for Mendel’s hypothetical factors. It
was recognized that chromosomes, which could be distinguished, quantiﬁed, and
observed to occur in pairs, except in germ cells, housed the genetic material. Germ cells
were demonstrated to have only one copy of each chromosome pair, with fusion of the
germ-cell nuclei restoring a complete set of chromosomes, half from the father and half
from the mother. A late highlight in this development was the work of Cyril Darlington
(1903–1981), who made the connection between the structural behavior of chromo-
somes, including the mechanics of chromosomal recombination, and the functional
consequences in terms of heredity6. The chromosomal theory of inheritance, with its
distinction between somatic and germ cells, ended speculation by Darwin, Jean-Baptiste
Lamarck (1744–1829), and others that offspring were a mere blending of the parents
and that acquired traits could be inherited.
It was also around this time that the terms phenotype and genotype began to be distin-
guished. The phenotype of an individual organism comprises its observable traits (such
as size or eye color) whereas the genotype is the genetic endowment underlying the phe-
notype. Of note, in those early days the genotype could only be determined on the basis
of the phenotype because the nature of the genetic material was still unknown.Therefore,
inheritance patterns could only be checked by breeding experiments. Based on the early
separation between somatic and germ cells, August Weismann (1834–1914) ﬁrst formu-
lated the unidirectional theory that the phenotype cannot affect the genotype7. The dis-
tinction of germ line and soma would profoundly inﬂuence our ideas about aging.
Weismann recognized that the germ cells are not affected by any variation that might
occur in an individual. This is especially relevant for somatic changes in the structure of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which we now know is the carrier of the genetic informa-
tion.Such changes,termed mutations,in a somatic cell may damage the cell,kill it,or turn
it into a cancer cell. But, whatever its effect, a somatic mutation is doomed to disappear
when the cell in which it occurred or its owner dies. By contrast, germ-line mutations
such as the one that gave rise to Morgan’s white-eye trait, will be found in every cell
descended from the zygote to which that mutant gamete contributed. If an adult is suc-
cessfully produced, every one of its cells will contain the mutation. Included among these
will be the next generation of gametes, so if the owner is able to become a parent, that
mutation will pass down to yet another generation. Mutations in somatic cells may be
expressed, but are not passed on to further generations. Mutations in germ cells can be
both expressed and transmitted to descendents.
6
INTRODUCTION

The distinction between germ line and soma exists only in animals. In plants, cells
destined to become gametes can arise from somatic tissues. In organisms without sexual
reproduction, such as many unicellular organisms, there is no distinction between germ
and soma. In Weismann’s view, the soma simply provides the housing for the germ line,
seeing to it that the germ cells are protected,nourished,and combined with the germ cells
of the opposite sex to create the next generation.This provided the logical basis for reject-
ing the ideas of Lamarck and others that characters acquired during lifetime could be
inherited by the next generation.Weismann’s views foreshadowed the concept by Richard
Dawkins (Oxford, UK) of the gene as the fundamental unit of selection, instead of
species, group, or individual8, as well as the disposable soma theory of aging by Tom
Kirkwood (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK)9.
Weismann was also the ﬁrst to explain the aging of metazoa in evolutionary terms. In
the ﬁrst instance he proposed that aging was an evolutionary adaptation to avoid the need
for offspring to compete with their parents for scarce resources.The idea that old individ-
uals die as an act of altruism to the rest of the group or species is now generally considered
as naive and incompatible with the negligible impact of aging on animals in the wild (few
animals survive long enough to experience old age). However, Weismann also presented
the case for aging as a non-adaptive trait, which would again foreshadow modern think-
ing about why we age. In this case, he argued that characters that have become useless to
an organism,such as eyesight in animals that never see the light,are not subject to natural
selection. Applied to the ‘useless period of life following the completion of reproductive
duty’ this theory would predict a weakening of selection against characters with adverse
effects later in life.Moreover,it predicts the positive selection of such traits if there is some
beneﬁt in the earlier years of life7.
In the 1940s, Weismann’s neodarwinism was integrated with new ﬁndings in labora-
tory genetics and ﬁeldwork on animal populations.This so-called evolutionary synthesis,
in a sense the grand ﬁnale of the work begun by Darwin and his predecessors,started with
T.H. Morgan, mentioned above, and reached a new height during the ﬁrst decades of
the twentieth century with the work of the great mathematical population geneticists,
Ronald Fisher (1890–1962), Sewall Wright (1889–1988), and J.B.S. Haldane (1892–1964).
They developed quantitative genetics as a synthesis of statistics, Mendelian principles, and
evolutionary biology.They demonstrated that the same principles that applied to discrete
traits (such as eye color) were also valid for quantitative traits, such as height and certain
behavioral characteristics, which display continuous variation in the population. These
concepts were later combined with explanations for the origin of biodiversity by
Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900–1975),the previously mentioned Ernst Mayr,and others,
resulting in the integration of Mendel’s theory of heredity with Darwin’s theory of
evolution and natural selection.
The uniﬁcation of genetics and evolution by natural selection also gave rise to the
ﬁrst discussions—in the new, mathematical language of the modern synthesis—of the
INTRODUCTION
7

evolutionary basis of aging. It was Fisher who noticed, probably for the ﬁrst time, that the
chance of individuals to contribute to the future ancestry of their population declines
with age10.Later,this would lead Peter Medawar (1915–1987),a Nobel laureate and better
known for his work on transplantation immunology, to propose that aging, at least in
sexually reproducing organisms with a difference between the soma and the germ line, is
a result of the declining force of natural selection with age (see Chapter 2 in this volume).
What was still not clear at the time was the nature of a gene and the mechanism of
Mendel’s transmission of heritable traits through the germ line. It was only in 1944 that
Oswald Avery (1877–1955) and collaborators made a convincing case for DNA as the
carrier of the genes11. They were studying a substance that could turn non-pathogenic
variants (R cells) of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium that causes pneumonia, into
pathogenic ones (S cells). This so-called transforming principle, which had a high molec-
ular mass, was resistant to heat or enzymes that destroy proteins and lipids, and it could
be precipitated by ethanol. Hence, it was most likely DNA, a substance already described
by Johann Friedrich Miescher (1844–1895) in 1869 as occurring in human white blood
cells and in the sperm of trout. However, the nature of the genetic code and a mechanism
for how DNA was able to transfer this information from cell to cell and how it could
convert this information into cellular function was still unknown. James Watson (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY, USA) and Francis Crick (1916–2004) provided the
answer in 1953 in the form of the molecular structure of DNA: two helical strands of
alternating sugar-phosphate sequences, each coiled round the same axis, held together by
adenine–thymine- and cytosine–guanine-speciﬁc base pairing.The base pairing properties
of DNA dictate the mechanism of gene replication12.
Hence, it was now known that the complete set of genetic information of an organism,
the genome, was written in its DNA. Genomes, which can vary widely in size, from
600 000 bp in a small bacterium to 3 billion in a mammal, were subsequently demon-
strated to be the repository of the genes, the basic physical and functional units of hered-
ity. The years immediately after Watson and Crick are now known as the classical period
of molecular biology. First, Matthew Meselson (Cambridge, MA, USA) and Franklin
Stahl (Eugene, OR, USA) experimentally conﬁrmed13 the process of semiconservative
DNA replication predicted by the double-helical,base-paired model proposed by Watson
and Crick. DNA isolated from Escherichia coli after growth in medium containing heavy
or light isotopes of nitrogen showed a distinct density distribution in CsCl gradients.
After switching medium, DNA of an intermediate density was obtained, which is
expected if the newly replicated DNA is a hybrid molecule consisting of one parental and
one newly synthesized strand.
Then, following the prediction by François Jacob (Paris, France) and Jacques Monod
(1910–1976) that messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcribed from the DNA of a
gene in the form of a single-strand complementary copy was the template for protein
synthesis14, Crick, Sydney Brenner (San Diego, CA, USA) and colleagues15 demonstrated
in 1961, by deleting bases one by one from DNA of the bacteriophage T4, that the genetic
8
INTRODUCTION

code was a triplet of bases. A string of triplets speciﬁes the full sequence of amino acids
in a protein chain. Using a cell-free translation system and synthetic homopolymers,
Marshall Nirenberg (Bethesda, MD, USA)16 and Har Gobind Khorana (Cambridge, MA,
USA)17 identiﬁed which codons corresponded to which amino acids. Meanwhile, the
laboratories of Mahlon Hoagland (Worcestor,MA,USA)18,Robert Holley (1922–1993)19,
and others had discovered transfer RNA (tRNA), predicted by Crick in his adaptor
hypothesis as the entity that recognized triplets of bases on the mRNA.Adaptor enzymes
link each kind of amino acid to the appropriate carrier, tRNA. Protein synthesis or
translation is carried out by bringing the mRNA and the set of tRNAs charged with
the appropriate amino acids to the ribosomes, discovered earlier as the protein-making
apparatus in the cytoplasm.
The guiding role of Francis Crick in bringing this classical period to its zenith is now
well recognized. Crick’s predictions that the genetic code was universal to all forms of life
and that genetic information can go only one way—that is, from DNA via RNA to pro-
tein—proved correct with minor exceptions. This so-called central dogma of molecular
biology is another way of saying that acquired characteristics cannot be inherited.
With the discovery of the structure of DNA and the genetic code, the origin of
Darwin’s existing natural differences in heritable traits had also become clear. DNA in the
living cell is not completely stable, but can undergo alterations in its base pair composi-
tion through errors during replication or the repair of chemical damage. Hermann
Joseph Muller (1890–1967), a student of T.H. Morgan, had already demonstrated in
192720 that mutations could be induced by radiation. He identiﬁed mutations mainly by
the observed effect on an organism, but was able to show that mutations can result from
breakages in chromosomes and changes in individual genes. He also realized that the
majority of such random mutational changes are deleterious, although an occasional
mutation is beneﬁcial, for example, by giving rise to a better-functioning protein.
However,as we now know,the genetic code is tolerant of certain mutations.This degener-
ation of the code is due to the fact that there are three times as many codons as there are
amino acids,hence the tolerance of some amino acids for a mismatch at the third position
of each triplet.
With the evolutionary synthesis and the new understanding of its underlying molecu-
lar principles, the pursuit of the origin and perpetuation of life was essentially over. From
now on, biology could fully focus on unraveling the structure and function of life’s vari-
ous manifestations.
1.1.2 SEARCHING FOR STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
The desire to know all structural,organizational,and functional facets of life sprung from
the same source as the theory of evolution and modern genetics: the careful observations
made by the pioneers of science in the seventeenth century, with microscopy as their

main tool. Then, as now, there was a signiﬁcant relationship between the ability of
craftsmen to provide good instrumentation and the direction of scientiﬁc investigation.
Most notable among these early scientists, apart from the above-mentioned Antonie van
Leeuwenhoek, was his contemporary, Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694). Malpighi was
probably the ﬁrst scientist to use model organisms—frogs and turtles—to obtain struc-
tural information on human organs, thereby inventing comparative anatomy. Following
the early work of William Harvey (1578–1657) on human blood circulation, Malpighi
discovered blood ﬂow through capillaries in the lungs, opening the way to understanding
the function of this organ in respiration. He conducted a famous comparative study of
the liver, from snails through ﬁshes and reptiles, right up to humans, and he was the ﬁrst
to give an adequate description of the development of the chick in the egg21.
At this time, it had begun to dawn from Leeuwenhoek’s work, as well as from micro-
scopic observations by the great British natural philosopher Robert Hooke (1635–1703),
that life was organized around a basic unit, termed a cell by Hooke. However, it took until
1839 before Mathias Schleiden (1804–1881) and Theodor Schwann (1810–1882) could
make the conclusion that cells were the basic units of life. In animals, cells were progres-
sively organized into tissues, organs, systems, and, ﬁnally, the whole body. The adult
human body is an aggregate of more than 75 trillion cells. With the birth of modern
cell theory, anatomists had widened their scope and new disciplines emerged, such as
embryology, cytology, and physiology, all focused on understanding the mechanisms of
life in all its facets, and how this unfolds from a fertilized egg to an adult organism.
Meanwhile, in studying various life forms, the early scientiﬁc community was struggling
with the question of whether organisms were integrated wholes, as advocated by Georges
Cuvier (1769–1832), or whether morphology could be changed and affected by environ-
mental conditions, as proposed by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844). In other
words,does function strictly dictate form with no modiﬁcation possible,or do body plans
constrain how organ functions are manifested? These positions, which were later synthe-
sized, remain a leitmotiv for modern systems biology and functional genomics.
The dramatic increase in our understanding of how structure follows function was a
result of the application of new insights in chemistry, most notably organic chemistry, to
study different cellular components. This would ﬁrst lead to biochemistry, the science
dealing with the chemistry of living matter, and ultimately to molecular biology, the
branch of biology dealing with the nature of biological phenomena at the molecular level
through the study of DNA, RNA, proteins, and other macromolecules involved in genetic
information and cell function. The undisputed highlight of this development was our
ultimate understanding of how cells harvest the energy of food through the conversion of
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into the energy-carrying compound adenosine triphos-
phate (ATP) in subcellular structures called mitochondria. In his 1961 paper22, Peter
Mitchell (1920–1992) introduced the chemiosmotic hypothesis,connecting the electron-
transport chain,through a proton (H+) gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane,
10
INTRODUCTION

with oxidative phosphorylation and the synthesis of ATP. Critically important to all
biology and shaping our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of this most
important of all cellular activities, the elegance of the chemiosmotic model in correlating
structure and function would have been appreciated by Cuvier.
The universality of the process of oxidative phosphorylation suggests its importance as
a factor in aging. Ironically, even before Mitchell’s landmark paper, another chemist,
Denham Harman (Omaha,NE,USA),proposed that free radicals,the adverse by-products
of oxidative phosphorylation, were a ubiquitous cause of aging23. This hypothesis is
known as the free radical theory of aging and has been with us ever since.Free radicals are
now generally considered as a most likely explanation for the damage that ultimately
leads to our demise. It also drew attention to the mitochondria and their own independ-
ent genome, so close to the origin and main source of free radicals. Distinct from the far
larger nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome is now considered a major target for
spontaneous mutagenesis.In turn,this may adversely affect the process of oxidative phos-
phorylation itself, thereby accelerating formation of free radicals. This is described in
detail in Chapter 6.
As we have seen, molecular biology provided the insight that proteins were the work-
horses of biological systems, and DNA the carrier of genetic information, organized in
the form of a genome. Genes were shown to be speciﬁc sequences of base pairs that con-
tain the instructions, in the form of a triplet code, for making proteins. Interestingly, not
long after the discovery of the fundamental mechanism of protein biosynthesis, Leslie E.
Orgel (San Diego CA, USA) proposed in 1963 that cellular aging involves the accumula-
tion of defective proteins as a result of an inherent inaccuracy of the translational machin-
ery. This is generally known as the error catastrophe theory of aging and longevity, based
on Orgel’s realization that the faulty RNA and DNA polymerases, also resulting from
translational errors, could lead to an exponential increase of defects in protein, RNA, and
DNA, causing the collapse of the cellular machinery for information transfer. This idea is
not supported by experimental evidence, but it can be argued that errors are random,
with each cell acquiring a unique set of errors. Since current technology is geared towards
analyzing mixtures of cells rather than individual cells,we may simply be unable to detect
error catastrophes.
In the decades following the discovery of the double helix, and especially after the
development of recombinant DNA technology, molecular biology became a premier
discipline in biology, always at the cutting edge of new developments. Initially, molecular
biology remained separate from more traditional disciplines, such as physiology.
However, gradually these other disciplines would include molecular biology as an aide
in support of their own research endeavors. Meanwhile, the realization of the extreme
complexity of the gene–phenotype relationship necessitated a whole new approach,
which coincided with the informatics explosion, bringing powerful new computers and
the internet. Eventually this would lead to a departure from the original reductionist

approaches to holistic strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of life,
and the emergence of functional genomics and systems biology.
1.2 From genetics to genomics
In the heydays of molecular biology it seemed natural to begin our effort of understand-
ing the structure and function of various life forms with understanding individual genes
and their activities in different organisms. Indeed, after Watson and Crick, the central
dogma may have clariﬁed the mechanisms underlying Mendel’s laws, but virtually all
known genes were still identiﬁed only by mutations and their phenotypic consequences.
Genetics was a matter of studying inherited phenotypes,rather than genes,none of which
had been isolated before 1973, when Stanley N. Cohen of Stanford University and
Herbert W.Boyer of the University of California,San Francisco,developed the laboratory
process to take DNA from one organism and propagate it in a bacterium. This process,
called recombinant DNA technology, was used in 1977 for the production of the ﬁrst
human protein manufactured in a bacterium: somatostatin, a human growth hormone-
releasing inhibitory factor. For the ﬁrst time, a synthetic, recombinant gene was cloned
and used to produce a protein24. The following decade saw a surge in the study of genes
and their function, for which Tom Roderick (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) in 1986 coined the
term genomics. Genomics was highly technology-driven, as exempliﬁed by the rapid
emergence of a host of new techniques and instruments.The undisputed highlight of this
development was the discovery, by Kari Mullis, then at the Cetus Corporation, of the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique for amplifying DNA sequences in vitro by
separating the DNA into two strands and incubating them with oligonucleotide primers
and DNA polymerase (Fig.1.1).PCR can amplify a speciﬁc DNA sequence as many as one
billion times, and quickly became essential in biotechnology, forensics, medicine, and
genetic research as probably no method before.
Initially, genomics was not different from standard, investigator-initiated research and
was entirely hypothesis-driven. This would change with the conception of the Human
Genome Project (HGP), the international research effort that determined the DNA
sequence of the entire human genome.The rationale behind the HGP was that by sequenc-
ing a complex genome, the amino acid sequences of all proteins as well as all sequence-
encoded regulatory and structural characteristics of that genome would be immediately
available, obviating the need to purify and characterize each feature separately. Cloning
genes into expression vectors allowed the production of proteins, but also allowed their
engineering, for example, for studying their phenotypic characteristics in cell cultures
or experimental animals. Indeed, it was around this time—in the 1980s—that the meth-
ods to make transgenic mice were developed by Jon Gordon (New York, NY, USA)25,

animal, in particular how and why a speciﬁc gene is turned on in some tissues and turned
off in others.This diversity of gene expression that produces the distinct cell types and tis-
sues of the body, making a muscle cell different from a liver cell, had quickly become of
central interest in molecular biology. Access to comprehensive genome sequences of dif-
ferent species allowed scientists to systematically address this question.

It was realized early on that the average research laboratory was too small to contribute
signiﬁcantly to such a project and that methods of scale were needed. This resulted in
most of the work being done by large genome centers. Contributors to the HGP included
the US National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Energy (where discussions

of the HGP began as early as 198427), numerous universities throughout the USA, and
international partners in the UK, France, Germany, Japan, and China. A separate, com-
mercial project to sequence the human and other genomes was initiated in 1998 by the
Celera Genomics Corporation28. In the course of completing the sequence, two separate
interim working drafts of the human genome were produced in 2001 with much public-
ity by both the public consortium29 and Celera30.However,the major aim of the HGP was
to obtain a comprehensive, ‘ﬁnished’ sequence of the entire 3109-base haploid human
genome, which was eventually published in 2004 and contained 2.85 billion nucleotides,
covering 99% of the euchromatic genome. The paper in Nature reporting this accom-
plishment had over 2800 authors, an example of the emergence of large consortia of
researchers at the expense of the more classical investigator-initiated approach of the
past31. To the surprise of many, the complete sequence of the human genome did not
immediately tell us how many human genes there are. This uncertainty is likely to last
for a while because of the limitations in gene-prediction software, which thus far have
precluded an accurate assessment of the total number of human protein-coding genes.
It is generally thought that this number is somewhere around 30 000.
In hindsight,the achievement of its primary goal may have been less important than the
impact of the HGP on the way biological research was conducted. Its legacy will probably
always be associated with the transformation of biology from an almost exclusively soli-
tary, hypothesis-driven science into an information science. This was based on the use of
high-throughput methods and the increasing need to organize research as large collabora-
tive efforts of multiple investigators from various disciplines. However, rather than aban-
doning individual,hypothesis-driven research,this development is more likely to eventually
lead to the iterative and integrative approach of global analyses driven by hypothetical
models,now known as a systems approach.I will discuss this extensively below.
The main driving force behind the globalization of biological research was the addi-
tional goal of the HGP to develop novel technologies and improve existing ones.The suc-
cess of the HGP in converting regular methods in molecular biology into methods of
scale is exempliﬁed by the great improvements in the sequencing method ﬁrst described
by Frederick Sanger (Cambridge,UK) and co-workers in 197732.This method is based on
the use of a DNA polymerase to extend, in four separate reactions, an oligonucleotide
primer from its annealing site at the beginning of the target sequence over a length of
500–1000 bp. Each reaction contains all four deoxynucleotide triphosphates plus a limit-
ing amount of either adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine dideoxynucleotide triphos-
phate,which terminate the reaction upon incorporation.After electrophoretic separation
of each fragment mixture at a resolution of 1 bp, the sequence of the target can be read
directly from the resulting banding pattern (Fig. 1.2).
Initially, radioactive labeling was used to detect the fragments after size separation.
Later, ﬂuorescent labels were developed, which allowed automated detection of the
electrophoretically separated fragments using a laser33. From this ﬁrst partial automation

of the Sanger dideoxy sequencing principle to the current, almost fully automated 
384-capillary electrophoresis systems there has been an approximately 2000-fold increase
in throughput. Ironically, this has not been achieved by new technology, as originally
anticipated, but almost exclusively by the introduction of methods of scale. Although
such improvements have now made it relatively easy to obtain the consensus sequence of
a genome quickly, especially that of a small microbe, conventional sequencing is still not
cost-effective enough for routine application,for example,in large-scale genetic epidemi-
ology or clinical diagnosis. It is anticipated that novel sequencing principles, including
single-molecule sequencing34, will successfully address remaining limitations in cost,
speed, and sensitivity. In this respect, it has been predicted that about 10 years from now
it will be possible to sequence an entire human genome in 30 min for about $100035.
In addition to the human genome, hundreds of genomes of other species, from simple
microorganisms, such as E. coli36, to the mouse, rat, and chimpanzee37, have now been
sequenced completely. The information that can be derived from these sequences is vast.
Large-scale sequencing totally transformed certain disciplines as genetics and physiology
and created new ones, such as comparative genomics, the most powerful way to elucidate
the roles of many related genes. Although the practice of comparing gene or protein
sequences with each other, in the hope of elucidating functional and evolutionary signiﬁ-
cance, is well established, its application to complete genomes greatly expands its utility
and implications. For example, phylogenetic trees can be built not from the sequences of
a single gene (usually ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes) but from multiple gene sequences as
well as from non-sequence information, such as similarities in gene repertoire and gene
order38. This requires the rational classiﬁcation of genes and proteins, which is usually
done in the form of a system of orthologous gene sets. (Orthologs are homologous genes
that evolved from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of the compared
genomes; paralogs are genes related via duplication within a genome.) Major applica-
tions of cross-species genome comparisons are the identiﬁcation of functionally impor-
tant genomic elements, e.g. protein-coding and regulatory sequences, on the basis of
homology39. This is based on the assumption that functionally important regions tend to
have a lower mutation rate than non-functional regions. The rapid increase in whole-
genome sequences from different mammals and the development of better tools for their
comparison should lead to increased insight into the functional constraints of the human
genome.
The HGP has also been the starting point for several new, large-scale initiatives in
genomics. For example, the establishment of a catalog of all common sequence variants
(single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) in the human genome with their patterns of
linkage disequilibrium (the HapMap project) has been initiated to facilitate the identiﬁ-
cation of genetic risk factors in disease susceptibility and other phenotypes, whereas the
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project aims to identify different functional
16
INTRODUCTION

elements in the human genome40. The latter is very much based on the realization that
gene function can only be understood in the context of the genome as a whole, with its
multiple overlapping networks of regulatory sequences. All these large-scale genome
projects are part of a general development to collect biological information in a system-
atic way and make it publicly available. The rapid growth of the Internet around the same
time greatly facilitated the use of such shared resources, which now play a crucial role in
conducting biological research and have become the basis for functional genomics and
systems biology.
1.3 A return to function
Complete DNA sequence information is not the end, but merely the beginning of our
quest to understand how genomes—and therefore organisms—function and how time,
both evolutionary time and the lifetime of an individual,can affect such function.For this
purpose, genes need to be identiﬁed; the function of their products (RNAs and proteins)
must be elucidated and the role of non-coding regulatory sequences needs to be under-
stood. Since the landmark completion of the HGP, the type of biology focused on the
identiﬁcation and functional analysis of genes, coding regions, and other functional ele-
ments of entire genomes on a high-throughput basis has been termed functional
genomics. Whereas genomics implies the study of genes and their function, functional
genomics attempts to integrate all genes, their products, and their resultant phenotypes
into dynamic networks of molecular pathways that ultimately determine our physiology
(Fig. 1.3). Such networks of interaction have now all but replaced the original one-
gene/one-protein way of thinking.
If the advances of molecular biology and genomics had made anything clear, it was the
stupendous complexity of living cells and their interactions to generate complete func-
tioning organisms. A discrete biological function can only rarely be attributed to one
individual protein encoded by one gene. In reality, biological characteristics involve com-
plex interactions among many components in cells, such as DNA, RNAs, proteins, and
small molecules.Emphasizing this integrative nature of biological function,Hartwell and
Hopﬁeld coined the term functional modules41. In functional genomics, a distinction is
made between the different levels of organization in the cell. The genome, as we have
seen, denotes the totality of all genes on all chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell. The
complete set of mRNAs, the next hierarchical level below the genome, is called the tran-
scriptome. Next, there is the proteome, which is the set of all expressed proteins for a
given organism. This is followed by the metabolome, a biochemical snapshot of the small
molecules produced during cellular metabolism,such as glucose,cholesterol,and ATP,and
INTRODUCTION
17

several other comprehensive sets of biological information, such as the secretome (total
of secreted molecules) and the interactome (a complete set of macromolecular interac-
tions, such as protein–protein interactions).
Functional genomics was driven by the need to understand the formal relationships
between genes and all the -omes, including the rules that control transition between these
levels and from them to complex, functional systems, such as oxidative phosphorylation,
genome maintenance, and the immune system. A key aim now became to systematically
catalog all molecules and their interactions in a living cell. To do this, high-throughput
methods for genome-wide data collection have become indispensable. Since the discovery
of genes has outpaced our capacity to understand their biology,high-throughput methods
to assess genotype–phenotype relationships are rapidly being developed and applied.
The most popular vehicle for high-throughput analysis in biology has become the
microarray chip. In its ﬁrst successful manifestation, hundreds to thousands or tens of

thousands of cDNAs or oligonucleotides, complementary to parts of individual
mRNAs, were attached to a glass slide. Hybridization of such slides with labeled probes
obtained from reverse-transcribed RNA from tissues or cells of interest permits the
analysis of changes in expression of a large number of genes simultaneously. This tech-
nology has the ability to reveal patterns of gene expression across different samples. For
this purpose, genes are grouped into classes with similar proﬁles of activity, in an
approach called cluster analysis. Such genes may have related functions or be regulated
by common mechanisms. The structured gene-functional-categorization database,
Gene Ontology or GO, provides the opportunity to partition genes into functional
classes. Microarrays are now also used to study DNA sequence variations (SNPs), pro-
teins, protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions, and various other structural
characteristics of the cell or tissue.
Another tool that can be applied in a microarray format on a genome-wide scale,RNA-
mediated interference (RNAi), proved to be of critical importance in bridging the gap
between genotype and phenotype that had opened up since T.H. Morgan. First demon-
strated in 1998 in Caenorhabditis elegans42,RNAi allows the sequence-speciﬁc silencing of
genes using synthetic double-stranded RNAs. Such exogenous RNAs co-opt a ubiqui-
tously expressed, evolutionarily conserved gene-regulatory system consisting of micro-
RNAs (miRNAs; Chapter 3). Endogenous miRNAs are transcribed as single-stranded
precursors up to 2000 bp in length and exhibit signiﬁcant secondary structure, resulting
in stems and loops. Such primary transcripts are ﬁrst processed in the nucleus and after
entering the cytoplasm converted by the RNase III enzyme Dicer into double-stranded
21–23-nucleotide-long mature RNAs. Synthetic forms of miRNAs, so-called short hair-
pin RNAs (shRNAs), can be used experimentally to mimic their natural equivalents.
Alternatively, it is possible to use short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), synthetic double-
strand RNAs of less than 30 bp. Such siRNAs bypass cleavage by Dicer. All the small dou-
ble-stranded RNAs need to associate with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC),
which unwinds them and associates stably with the strand that is complementary to the
target mRNA. Depending on the degree of homology, the complexes inhibit gene activity
either by translational repression or triggering mRNA degradation. Apart from using
synthetic variants of these RNAs, it is also possible to express them using a plasmid to
silence gene expression for longer periods of time43. RNAi is a typical example of reverse
genetic technology and can conveniently be applied in a microarray format.RNAi at such
a genome-wide scale was applied early on in the science of aging to screen for genes regu-
lating lifespan (Chapter 2).
In general,variation greatly increases from DNA to RNA to protein.For example,while
the entire human genome may contain no more than 30 000 genes, there may be three
times that many proteins, due to alternative splicing; this is the production of more than
one transcript by including or excluding speciﬁc exons (the DNA segments of a gene that
are protein-coding; see Chapter 3) or altering the length of a speciﬁc exon.This is without
INTRODUCTION

taking into account posttranslational modiﬁcation, such as the attachment of phosphate,
acetate, lipid, or sugar groups. To systematically describe the proteome and its different
patterns of interaction in a complex organism is therefore more difﬁcult than making an
inventory of all genes. This is especially true because microarray technology for proteins
is less well developed as it is for genes.Nevertheless,progress in this ﬁeld is now also rapid,
resulting in ever larger sets of proteins often subdivided according to their speciﬁc modi-
fication. For example, protein phosphorylation is estimated to affect 30% of the proteome
and is a major regulatory mechanism that controls many basic cellular processes. Using
microarray technology, the in vitro substrates recognized by most yeast protein kinases
were recently identiﬁed, involving over 4000 phosphorylation events and 1325 different
proteins. This collection of data was called the phosphorylome44.
With phenotypic variation much more extensive than genotypic variation and an
increasing number of global data-sets emerging at ever-shorter time intervals, the result-
ing deluge of data is truly transforming molecular biology, from the focused analysis of
single genes and proteins to the systematic analysis of entire networks of coupled bio-
chemical reactions and feedback signals. In this respect, the HGP has taught us to see the
study of genomes as information science that requires support by advanced computa-
tional biology tools and databases. The new discipline of bioinformatics plays a critical
role in implementing this endeavor. Bioinformatics uses information technology to
organize, visualize, interpret, and distribute biological information to answer complex
biological questions. It allows workers in functional genomics to cope with the ﬂood of
data and address biological questions in a fraction of the time it would take using tradi-
tional analysis techniques. It is bioinformatics that enables functional genomics to bring
order out of a vast number of data points.
A central component of functional genomics,driven by high-throughput methods and
information science, is the ability to standardize extensive sets of disparate data. A key
attribute in standardizing biological databases, which makes them computationally
accessible, is an ontology. An ontology formally deﬁnes a common set of terms that are
used to describe and represent a domain. Such vocabularies of terms specify the concepts
in a given ﬁeld and avoid semantic confusion. An example is the Gene Ontology, which
can be used to describe the biological process,molecular function,and cellular location of
any gene product. Ontologies have also become important in systematically collecting
phenotypic information. As mentioned above, the term phenotype refers to observable
traits and can be applied to any morphologic, biochemical, physiologic, or behavioral
characteristic of an organism. The complete phenotypic representation of a species is
now known as its phenome. The Mouse Phenome Project is a consortium of academic
and industrial participants that promotes the quantitative phenotypic characterization of
a deﬁned set of mouse strains under standardized conditions.Such coordinated efforts in
obtaining phenomic databases are now replacing phenotypic investigations carried out
by thousands of independent investigators throughout the world, most of whom have no
20
INTRODUCTION

communication with each other. Standardized and comprehensive, such databases are
critically important in the unraveling of molecular networks in the context of a func-
tional unit, such as an organ or an organism.
An important condition in using large, standardized data-sets in an efﬁcient manner
for testing hypotheses and generating new ones is their integration. A major challenge in
bioinformatics is to create single platforms for the integrated analysis of multiple,distrib-
uted data sources; for example phenotypic data with protein-interaction data and gene-
expression data. In other words, the different components of the biological landscape in
the form of the different -omics levels are pulled together to gain an understanding of
biology at a higher level. This convergence will happen in an approach known as systems
biology (Fig. 1.4). Systems biology studies the interrelationships of all the elements in a

system rather than studying them one at a time, in an effort to uncover hidden rules
governing the ensemble of biomolecules working concertedly to perform certain func-
tions in the cell. It aspires to use comprehensive data-sets, including such speciﬁcs as the
experimental conditions under which the data were obtained, for building predictive
models. In a sense, systems biology is the antithesis of the reductionist approach to biol-
ogy, which has been so successful in the past in providing insights into the molecular
machinery of many living systems and will continue to do so in further unraveling gene
function in functional genomics approaches. However, it did not and cannot provide an
understanding as to how molecular processes are integrated to provide function and how
molecular function is regulated in living cells so as to give rise to dynamic cell, tissue, and
organismal phenotypes.
General systems theory was conceived in the 1930s by the Austrian biologist Ludwig
Von Bertalanffy (1901–1972), whose ambition was to create a ‘universal science of organ-
ization’.His legacy is to have started systems thinking,thinking about a system as the emer-
gent property of the interaction among all the components of the system and not as mere
aggregates of its parts. System thinking in biology is not really new. Indeed, ever since the
early microscopists it was always realized that the sum is more than the individual parts.
In physiology, Claude Bernard (1813–1878) had already realized the common purpose of
diverse physiological mechanisms to maintain homeostasis45. In molecular biology, how-
ever, such an integrative approach only became possible with the emergence of high-
throughput technologies for measuring the large numbers of functionally diverse sets of
elements in a cell with their patterns of selective interactions. Systems biology has now
become an integrated approach to modeling biological systems in their entirety and to
simulate their activity. For example, the human physiome project is to provide the frame-
work for modeling the human body using computational methods46.The key challenge in
these approaches is to distill the results of data-collection efforts into an interpretable
computational form as the basis of a predictive model.A systems approach,then,involves
repeated cycles of data collection and modeling. While systems biology is very far from
computing the behavior of even a single cell, signiﬁcant progress has been made. For
example, models of heart function have already reached astonishing levels of detail, accu-
racy, and predictive power, as illustrated by realistic simulations of the beating of normal
and abnormal hearts47.
Studying the living world has brought us from the earliest microscopical observations
of cells through the unraveling of the DNA sequence of hundreds of species to increas-
ingly extensive collections of cellular constituents.The question then became how to con-
vert this information into knowledge about the organism. Functional genomics and
systems biology show great promise in becoming the centerpoints for exploring func-
tionality in a quantitative manner, from the level of the genome and transcriptome to the
physiology of organs and whole organisms. Can we use these same approaches to unlock
the secrets of aging? And will that give us the means to develop interventions to ultimately
halt its devastating effects?
22
INTRODUCTION

1.4 The causes of aging: a random affair
What is aging? For practical reasons aging can be deﬁned as a series of time-related
processes occurring in the adult individual that ultimately bring life to a close. Aging is
the most complex phenotype currently known and the only example of generalized bio-
logical dysfunction.Its effects become manifest in all organs and tissues.Aging inﬂuences
an organism’s entire physiology,impacts function at all levels,and increases susceptibility
to all major chronic diseases. Organ systems communicate with each other in order to
maintain homeostasis. We need to decipher how these communications change over the
life course and which cells and biological macromolecules are involved in such changes.It
is therefore obvious that a systems approach is required to address the core problem of
biological aging: the loss of homeostasis.Indeed,a comprehensive explanation of how we
age requires an understanding at all levels of the decline of the many complex function-
ally interacting subsystems of an organism.Such insight should provide us with a rational
basis for tracking aging processes from their downstream manifestations to the primary
causes. Depending on what those causes are, this may in turn permit the identiﬁcation of
novel molecular and cellular targets for prevention and treatment of aging-related ill-
nesses through pharmacological means.
As we have seen, in the history of biology the discovery of the logic of life was followed
by an understanding of the logic of aging. Following Weismann’s original non-adaptive
concepts of explaining aging, most researchers now accept that aging is ultimately due to
the greater relative weight placed by natural selection on early survival or reproduction
than on maintaining vigor at later ages. This decline in the force of natural selection with
age is largely due to the scarcity of older individuals in natural populations owing to
mortality caused by extrinsic hazards (Chapter 2). By contrast, our understanding of the
proximal causes of aging is limited. One can argue that this is due in large measure to our
inability in the past to study aging systems.Instead,ample information has been gathered
about individual cellular components at various ages, but this has not allowed a clear
understanding of the integrated genomic circuits that control mechanisms of aging, sur-
vival,and responses to endogenous and environmental challenges.With the emergence of
functional genomics and systems biology, we ﬁnally have the opportunity to study aging
in a comprehensive manner, as a function of the dynamic network of genes that deter-
mines the physiology of an individual organism over time48.
Increased technological prowess increases conﬁdence levels. Our increased capacity to
handle complex problems in biology whetted appetites for knowing the pathways that
control the gradual changes in the structure and function of humans and animals that
occur with the passage of time and their relationship with functional decline,disease,and
death. In the past, aging was not always considered a serious biological problem. In con-
trast to a disease, aging was thought to be inevitable, with attempts to intervene in its
many adverse effects better left to charlatans trying to interest the public in anti-aging

products that often lack any rational basis. Perhaps in part because of unusual difﬁculties
in studying aging, its science was seen by many as less rigorous and mainly phenomeno-
logical. Nevertheless, it was in the days when aging research had a low proﬁle that some
major scientiﬁc minds laid the groundwork for our current understanding of why and
how we age. These individuals, true giants who laid the foundations for the science of
aging, include George Sacher (1917–1981), Nathan Shock (1906–1989), Bernard Strehler
(1925–2001), Alex Comfort (1920–2000), John Maynard Smith (1920–2004), Zhores
Medvedev (London, UK), Paola Timiras (Berkeley, CA, USA), Leonard Hayﬂick (San
Francisco, CA, USA), George Martin (Seattle, WA, USA), the previously mentioned
Denham Harman, and several others49.
Whereas charlatans and their anti-aging products have by no means disappeared,
studying longevity and aging has now become respected and its accomplishments fre-
quently evoke great enthusiasm, as exempliﬁed by an increasing number of high-proﬁle
publications and abundant interest from the respected lay press. This development was
greatly aided by the discovery, originally in the laboratory of Tom Johnson (Boulder, CO,
USA) in the early 1980s, that a single gene mutation, called age-1, dramatically extended
lifespan of the nematode worm C. elegans50. This was important because at that time it
was generally believed that aging was too complex to be signiﬁcantly delayed by altering a
single gene. This lack of single genes affecting the normal aging process made the ﬁeld
unattractive for scientists who were used to relying on consistent effects of a limited num-
ber of genes involved in speciﬁc mechanisms, related to developmental or disease
processes.
With the discovery of the ﬁrst gene affecting lifespan, aging had taken its place as a
problem that could be addressed by studying the coordinated action of the products of
multiple genes,similar to differentiation,development,and disease.In other words,aging
had become a worthy object of study and began to attract highly reputed,well-funded sci-
entists. At this point in time, there are hundreds of mutant genes in a variety of organ-
isms, from yeast and fruit ﬂies to mice, which increase longevity by dampening growth,
reproduction, energy metabolism, or nutrient sensing. There are also mutant genes that
cause accelerated aging, but these are not always generally accepted due to the difﬁculties
in demonstrating that reduced longevity is genuinely due to accelerated aging or merely a
result of a disease or developmental defect. This is discussed extensively in Chapter 5.
Nomenclature for genes affecting aging is confusing. Analogous to disease genes—
genes that cause disease when mutated—genes with mutations causing increased
longevity are sometimes called longevity genes. Since others speak of gerontogenes
and yet others of aging genes, this leads to difﬁculties in understanding the normal
function of the pathways in which these genes act. Since the pathway in which age-1
and other longevity mutants in the nematode acts is really pro-aging, I will consistently
call such genes aging genes. Longevity genes are genes encoding cellular processes that
protect the organism against toxic insult. I realize that this departs from the disease gene
24
INTRODUCTION

nomenclature, but since this was wrong in the ﬁrst place there is no need to also make the
same confusing mistake for aging.
As described in the next chapter, the novel approaches of functional genomics and sys-
tems biology greatly facilitate the further unraveling of the functional modules of
longevity control. Along these lines rapid progress is now being made in understanding
the pro-longevity responses that result from dampening the activities of aging genes. It is
likely that very soon the mechanisms of action of such genes and the network of interac-
tions that gives rise to increased longevity will be resolved. The problem of aging, how-
ever,has two faces and the speciﬁc programmatic responses extending lifespan is only one
of them.
Behind the other face of aging is stochasticity, an important aspect of biology in gen-
eral, but often ignored since random variation is difﬁcult to capture even with our cur-
rent, highly sophisticated, biological tool set.While programmatic responses may defend
us against toxic insults, it may be stochasticity that is behind the proximal cause of aging.
For some time, evidence has been emerging that aging is caused by the accumulation of
cellular damage, a random process. The programmatic component of aging may merely
control the rate and extent of damage accumulation through dampening growth and
reproductive processes with damage production as their inevitable side effects, or by
upregulating processes of cellular defense. As we shall see in the next chapter, organisms
are able to manipulate the allocation of their resources and balance reproductive efforts
against somatic maintenance and repair.For some species,such as C.elegans,this ﬂexibil-
ity is so high that interference in pathways of growth and reproduction, for example
through single-gene mutations, can lead to 6-fold increases in lifespan. However, such
dramatic effects are unlikely to occur in mammals due to their much greater complexity.
Hence, whereas functional-genomics approaches can help us to more fully understand
how lifespan is controlled in a variety of organisms,for studying aging it will be necessary
to focus on its proximal cause: the accumulation of somatic damage. In this respect,
there is now ample evidence that damage to the genome can explain many of the
most important phenotypes of aging. This book is focused on the possibility that the
genome is both the creative engine behind longevity, as this emerged during evolution
in ever more robust manifestations, and the main target of the somatic damage that
ultimately limits life.
Since the original emergence of a genome 3–4 billion years ago, there has been a diver-
gence into the current estimate of 30 million genomes, each representing a unique
species.Evolution by natural selection requires the occurrence of mutations.If beneﬁcial,
such mutations are perpetuated. It is through mutations that Darwinian selection could
lead to increasingly complex genomes and the adaptation of their hosts to the various
challenges of a continuously changing environment.Because they occur at random,most
mutations have adverse effects. During evolution, such genomes fall by the wayside as a
consequence of natural selection.
INTRODUCTION
25

Genomes are not only subject to variation in the germ cells transmitted by parents to
offspring.New variation accumulates also in the soma through mutation.Such instability
of the somatic genome is much more extensive than originally thought in the immediate
aftermath of the double helix. As we shall see later, organisms gradually move from
having cells with very similar genomes towards mosaics of cells each with their own
genotype.It is the thesis of this book that the same time-dependent instability of genomes
that gives rise to evolutionary diversity also leads to aging at the somatic level. In both
cases it can do that by randomly inﬂuencing the mechanisms by which genomes provide
function (Fig. 1.5).
In the following chapters I will describe the logic of random genome damage as a
major, highly conserved proximate cause of aging, discuss the ongoing efforts to unravel
the many factors that determine this gradual loss of genome integrity of somatic cells,and
critically review the evidence that genome alterations cause aging and its associated phe-
notypes, in the context of possible alternative explanations. In the ﬁnal chapter I will dis-
cuss the impact of genome deterioration on our options to delay, halt, or even reverse the
process of aging in mammals.

The logic of aging
In the eyes of many, the science of aging must look like a quest for the Holy Grail, a
confusing series of contradictory approaches towards some elusive object. Today the
ﬁeld can roughly be divided into three main branches (Fig. 2.1): the biometric branch,
seeing aging as inﬁnitely complex and hardly amenable to intervention; the induc-
tive branch, which attempts to explain aging in terms of few relatively simple, universal
mechanisms; and the regeneration and renewal branch, with its focus on replacement
and remodeling.
The early idea that aging is caused by the accumulation of mutations in the genome of
somatic cells is clearly part of the simplistic branch and stems from the time when it was
popular to explain aging as theories of a single cause51. Although such unitary theories
have recently undergone some revival with the discovery of conserved pathways regulat-
ing longevity in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals (discussed further
below)52, they lose a lot of appeal when confronted with the enormous complexity of the
aging process as it takes place in different species53. Nevertheless, explaining aging in
terms of one universal, driving force is not entirely unrealistic in view of the universality
of the principles behind the living world on this planet. In spite of its bewildering vari-
ability, all life is based on combinations of the same, relatively few molecular species—
sugars, fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleotides—and the single, universal, organizing
principle of a genome that perpetuates itself as sequences of nucleic acid but functions by
being expressed in the form of protein.
Is it possible that aging has its own inherent logic driven by a teleological process
towards a speciﬁc goal? This is not to say that as a biological process aging could have
some cosmic purpose.Such matter is beyond the scope of this book and beyond the scope
of the biological sciences.However,whereas questions of what and how are often satisfac-
tory in physics, biology is full of goal-directed processes guided by programs. Good
examples are differentiation, development, and certain behavioral patterns. The ques-
tion, then, of why we age—that is, the evolutionary causation of aging as distinguished
from its proximate causes—is a legitimate one and should be actively pursued. Indeed, in
the past it is this type of question that has led to the most important discoveries in biol-
ogy. Whereas aging is different from most biological processes, in the sense that it resem-
bles mostly random degeneration, which is unlikely to be programmed, it could still have
its own logic,hidden in the depth of the history of life.If aging is inevitable,what then are
the characteristics of a genome to let that happen?

Fig. 2.1 The science of aging as a search for the Holy Grail: three different, parallel approaches,
often difﬁcult to reconcile.
2.1 Aging genes
One of the reasons why August Weismann’s original idea of aging as an adaptive trait,
which evolved to get rid of old, worn-out individuals (Chapter 1), makes little sense is the
unlikely event of meeting such an organism in the wild. Whereas in nature animals do
undergo aging, at least the early stages of the process, few if any of them ever reach the
advanced state of decrepitude experienced in protected environments, such as by labora-
tory animals or humans in advanced societies54. Animals in the wild are likely to die early,
from predation, starvation, or accidents, before the ravaging symptoms of aging can
become manifest55.There are,therefore,very few animals to experience the advanced stages
of aging in their natural habitat. In the past, the same used to be true for humans, only a
selected few of which had the good fortune to reach old age. This lack of expression of the
aging phenotype in nature makes it an unlikely target of natural selection. Hence, there are
no genes that cause aging like there are genes that specify development and maturation.

THE LOGIC OF AGING
29
That aging is nevertheless a real biological phenomenon common to most animal species
can be derived from the observation that under protective conditions individuals of the
same species, which in the wild never have the opportunity to get old, now reveal all the
phenotypic characteristics of increased structural and functional degeneration, ulti-
mately causing their death.
The aging phenotype and the similarities of many of its characteristics within and
among species will be discussed in some detail in Chapters 5 and 7. Here I will only point
out the main reason why we believe that aging is a genetically controlled process of intrin-
sic degeneration and not just a series of accidental changes over time. If aging as a biolog-
ical process did not exist, one would expect the probability of death to stay the same with
advancing age. However, in protective environments with the threat of external mortality
effectively minimal, the probability of death increases exponentially with age once matu-
rity is reached. This was ﬁrst discovered by the British actuarian Benjamin Gompertz
(1779–1865) in 1825, when the average lifespan of humans had just begun its dramatic
rise. Gompertz showed that after about age 35 the probability of death doubles every
7 years. Of note, while this increase in mortality has been observed in all species that
undergo aging,at very old age it no longer seems to hold.This has been most convincingly
demonstrated for invertebrate species, large numbers of which can be studied relatively
easily. Large-scale studies of the lifespans of tens of thousands of medﬂies, fruit ﬂies, or
nematode worms have shown a deceleration of mortality at old age, which may in fact
also be true for humans56.
The slopes of the Gompertz plots (Fig. 2.2a) reﬂect the age-speciﬁc death rates (effec-
tively the rate of aging) and can be converted into survival curves (Fig. 2.2b).When com-
paring protected populations with non-aging populations in the wild, the Gompertz
plots and the survival curves reveal dramatic differences. The mortality curve for wild
animals no longer shows the exponential increase with age (because death is accidental
and independent of age) and the survival curve is not rectangular but concave in shape. It
would apply to animals that are subject to high rates of external mortality from predation
and other environmental factors. For most animals in the wild the situation is probably
somewhere between these extremes.
The survival curves reveal both the average lifespan of the population (the age at which
50% of the cohort has died) and the maximum lifespan, which is essentially the age of the
last survivor or the average age of the longest-lived percentile or decile. The average lifes-
pan or life expectancy is determined to a large extent by external factors. It can differ dra-
matically between the protected environment and the wild. The maximum lifespan is
much less dependent on environmental conditions and is basically a function of the
genetic make-up of the species. This explains why it does not change much when condi-
tions improve. Careful comparisons of maximum lifespans for different animal species
in captivity reveal signiﬁcant differences, which indicate that lifespan is under genetic
control (Fig. 2.3).

It should be kept in mind that lifespan values,especially maximum lifespans,are difﬁcult
to determine for animals in the wild because of difﬁculties in monitoring birth cohorts
and the limited opportunities to survive beyond the age of reproduction. Mice, for exam-
ple, may only live for a few months in the wild; they generally die early from predation

or cold. For humans survival curves can be generated from census mortality tables.
However, such data are only available for the last couple of hundred years and even then
not always fully reliable.Hence,although it is often argued that maximum lifespan is ﬁxed
this is really not supported by strong data. In fact, there is evidence, for example from the
observed deceleration of mortality at extreme old age mentioned above, that lifespan,
even maximum lifespan, is more ﬂuid that we tended to think (see Chapter 8 for a more
detailed discussion of these issues).
At a population level, then, aging can be deﬁned as a process that begins after maturity
and results in an increasing probability of death.It is accompanied,at the individual level,
by a gradual impairment of bodily functions, a host of structural changes and an
increased incidence of certain diseases. In principle aging can include positive alterations
and some have even deﬁned it as all possible changes in an organism between conception
and death. To indicate aging-related adverse changes exclusively some authors use the
word senescence,which can be deﬁned as those irreversible,deteriorative changes causing
functional decline, disease, and death in aged organisms. This is somewhat confusing
since, as we will see, senescence is also deﬁned as the irreversible loss of proliferative
activity of a population of cells,for example,yeast,protozoa,or mammalian cells.It is also
used to simply indicate the aging of cells. In this book I will frequently use the word
senescence in all these meanings. For more extensive discussions of aging in the animal
world I refer to some outstanding works by some of my colleagues who are much better
versed in the basic aspects of aging as a biological phenomenon. Examples are the monu-
mental Longevity, Senescence and the Genome by Caleb Finch57,Why We Age: What Science
is Discovering about the Body’s Journey Through Life’ by Steve Austad58, and Time of Our
Lives: the Science of Human Ageing’by Tom Kirkwood59.
The question has arisen as to how aging, which in evolutionary terms can be simply
deﬁned as the decline in ﬁtness after the period of ﬁrst reproduction,could ever emerge as
a distinct, albeit complicated, phenotype. Indeed, direct natural selection should favor
the suppression of senescence rather than its promotion. That is, the accidental inactiva-
tion of a gene causing a program of aging would provide an immediate selective advan-
tage to its carrier, resulting in a rapid spread of immortality. In the next sections I will
brieﬂy explain why this is not the case and how aging may have evolved as a natural conse-
quence of the logic of life.
2.1.1 AGING IS A BY-PRODUCT, NOT A GOAL OF 
NATURAL SELECTION
It is now generally accepted that the age-related decrease in ﬁtness is non-adaptive; that
is, it is not controlled by a purposeful genetic program similar to development. As we
have seen in Chapter 1, August Weismann was the ﬁrst to propose a non-adaptive
THE LOGIC OF AGING
31

explanation for aging. While, as just discussed, his name is generally associated with the
idea of aging as a beneﬁcial trait—evolved during evolution to cleanse the population of
old, worn-out individuals, consuming resources without being reproductively active—
Kirkwood and Cremer7 pointed out that a little later Weismann also developed a non-
adaptive explanation of aging. He recognized that if a speciﬁc function loses its
usefulness, for example, due to a change in the organism’s environment, natural selection
will start ignoring it and the character will degenerate and disappear. Being ignored by
natural selection is probably exactly what applies best to the supposedly useless period
of life when reproductive duty is fulﬁlled and the theoretical chances of surviving much
longer have become slim.Aging would therefore be the logical result of the declining force
of natural selection after the period of ﬁrst reproduction. Weismann, therefore, under-
stood that aging by itself is unlikely to have an advantage, which contradicts his earlier
idea of a beneﬁcial cleansing mechanism.
The non-adaptive concept of how aging could originate in nature was ﬁrst discussed
systematically by Peter Medawar in the 1950s60, going back to ideas of Fisher, Haldane,
and Hamilton10. Medawar proposed that aging was the necessary result of constitutional
mutations, accumulated in the germ line over evolutionary time, that reduce ﬁtness late
in life. As mentioned above, in the wild only a small fraction of a birth cohort will reach
advanced age while continuing to reproduce. Therefore, the later the adverse effects of
such mutations manifest after the period of ﬁrst reproduction,the less likely that they will
be weeded out by natural selection. The frequencies of such alleles, especially in small
populations, will then drift randomly from generation to generation. In this way, natural
selection acts to postpone adverse actions of genes until late age,when under normal con-
ditions no animals can be expected to be alive anymore. Under such conditions natural
selection does not ‘see’ the effect of these mutations, which only show up under more
optimal conditions, such as in captivity.
In general, natural populations experiencing low mortality, from predation or disease,
will postpone late adverse effects further than populations of the same species in a
habitat with high extrinsic mortality. Indeed, under conditions of high extrinsic mortal-
ity, lifespan would already be short, pushing back the reproductive period and removing
any evolutionary incentive to cleanse the genome from random mutations with adverse
effects after this period. In captivity, under optimal conditions, such animals would dis-
play shorter lifespans. In other words, their intrinsic mortality would adapt to their
extrinsic mortality.
Adaptation of intrinsic mortality to extrinsic mortality can also work the other way
around; that is, lifespan of a population of organisms can be extended by artiﬁcially
extending the period of reproduction. This has been demonstrated, for example, in out-
bred populations of D. melanogaster, the fruit ﬂy. Clare and Luckinbill61 restricted repro-
duction of this organism to late age, thereby increasing the intensity of selection during
the later portion of the lifespan. They did this for 21–29 generations, at two different
32
THE LOGIC OF AGING

larval densities. Populations with high and uncontrolled numbers of competing larvae
responded strongly to selection for late-life reproduction, with the length of adult life
increasing by as much as 50%. Under such conditions selection produced true-breeding
long-lived lines. When populations of developing larvae were held low, however,
longevity ﬂuctuated wildly during selection,showing little overall response.Interestingly,
this experimental design allowed the simultaneous demonstration of the existence of
natural pro-longevity gene variants and the strong inﬂuence of the environment on the
selection of these variants. Later, the prediction that higher extrinsic mortality rates lead
to the evolution of shorter lifespans in Drosophila was conﬁrmed by directly comparing
populations of wild ﬂies under conditions of high and low imposed mortality62.
Evidence that different levels of environmental hazards dictate longevity through evo-
lutionary selection has also come from studies of vertebrate animals in the wild.
Observations by Steve Austad (San Antonio,TX,USA) on two opossum populations,one
on an island not subject to predation and one on the mainland where they were exposed
to signiﬁcant predation, conﬁrmed the prediction that the island population had the
highest longevity63. Environment is also not the only factor that appears to play a role. In
general, attributes that reduce extrinsic mortality, such as wings (birds, bats), protective
shells (turtle), or brains (humans) are generally associated with increased longevity57,58.
However, the situation is not straightforward and other factors, such as ecology, play
important roles. The aforementioned selection of long-lived ﬂies through late-life repro-
duction only worked at high larval density. In a study of guppies derived from environ-
ments with high and low mortality rates, lifespan was found to be longest in streams
where predators co-occur with guppies and shorter in individuals reared in the upper
reaches of streams by waterfalls, from which predators are often excluded64. There are
several possible explanations for this unexpected ﬁnding, including a reduction in popu-
lation size of the guppies by the predators, which would result in an increase of the abun-
dance of food and other resources leading to increased survival65.
It should be noted that this (thus far) isolated ﬁnding does not falsify the evolutionary
theory of aging.It merely illustrates that unlike the situation in the physical sciences theo-
ries in biology are often ambiguous and have no impenetrable mathematical basis.This is
necessarily so when starting from the shared organizational features manifested by
organisms. It is not possible in biology to reject theories on the basis of Popper’s falsiﬁca-
tion principle. In biology exceptions are often the norm. This does not make biology
unphysical.It simply means that in biology generalizations are often based on inadequate
or incomplete theories.
The correlation between high extrinsic mortality and short lifespans may be a conse-
quence of the trade-off most organisms face between investment in somatic maintenance
and reproductive effort. This was ﬁrst recognized by Tom Kirkwood and formulated in
his disposable soma theory of aging9, already mentioned in Chapter 1. This theory pre-
dicts that high extrinsic mortality would favor investment of scarce resources in early
THE LOGIC OF AGING
33

reproduction rather than somatic maintenance and repair, which would not be required
for a population with a low risk of survival in the wild. This of course implies that age-
related somatic degeneration and death is caused by the accumulation of unrepaired
somatic damage, a reasonable explanation, which is now supported by a large body of
evidence. For example, the extended longevity in late-reproducing fruit ﬂies mentioned
above appeared to be associated with a coordinated upregulation of genes specifying
cellular defense mechanisms against free-radical attack. Consequently, these ﬂies showed
decreased levels of oxidative damage to proteins and lipids66. In addition, delayed senes-
cence in the long-lived ﬂies was accompanied by reduced fecundity, supporting the idea
of a trade-off between reproductive effort and survival (see also below).
2.1.2 AGING OF UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS
From an evolutionary point of view, therefore, age-related decline and death is the effect
of genetic variants (aging genes) that have escaped the force of natural selection by acting
only post-reproductively. Ultimately, this is due to the separation of soma from germ,
which creates a life cycle in which the soma is reconstructed in every generation from a
germinal blueprint. As we have seen, reconstruction of the soma (or reproduction) is
greatly favored by natural selection, especially under conditions of high external mortal-
ity. The fate of the old soma is not a priority. In essence, this means that the deleterious
effects of mutations accumulated in the germ line are shed to the parents. However, this
implies that unicellular organisms should not age because they do not have a distinction
between the germ line, which is to be preserved, and the soma, which is expendable.
Although for most unicellular species (as well as some metazoa without a clear distinc-
tion between germ line and somatic tissue, such as Hydra) there is indeed no evidence of
aging57, certain unicellular eukaryotes, such as budding yeast and protozoa, undergo a
process of cellular senescence after a given number of population doublings.In such cases
there usually is asymmetric division and it has been suggested that in parallel to the soma
of multicellular organisms, organisms such as yeast segregate their senescent changes to
the mother cell. Hence, like in most metazoa, the negative effects of aging are conﬁned to
the parent. A similar situation has been observed in asymmetrically dividing prokary-
otes67,68. Even in a symmetrically dividing organism, like E. coli, which divides by binary
ﬁssion into seemingly identical siblings, aging has recently been demonstrated. This was
attributed to inheritance of the old pole; that is,the end of the cell that has not been newly
created during division, but is pre-existing from a previous division. Old poles can exist
for many divisions, and by following repeated cycles of reproduction by individual cells,
through automated time-lapse microscopy, it was shown that the cell that inherits the old
pole exhibits a diminished growth rate, decreased offspring production, and an increased
incidence of death68.

THE LOGIC OF AGING

Protozoa have been studied extensively in the context of aging and reproduction.In his
beautiful book, Sex and Death in Protozoa69, Graham Bell (Montreal, Canada) has out-
lined in intricate detail many if not all key concepts of aging in unicellular organisms in
comparison with multicellular ones. Protozoa reproduce asexually, by ﬁssion, and some-
times also sexually, which is termed conjugation.Although protozoa do not divide asym-
metrically, they have a life cycle: immaturity, maturity, and senescence69. In a protozoan
clone, senescence occurs in the absence of conjugation. Conjugation involves fusion of
two paired individuals,meiosis of the diploid nucleus (termed the micronucleus as distinct
from the macronucleus, which disintegrates) and exchange of one gamete nucleus. After
fusion of gametes the diploid state is reconstituted and new individuals are generated.
Conjugation prevents senescence, which only occurs in its absence. The zoologist Tracy
Morton Sonneborn (1905–1981) discovered in the early 1950s that autogamy, the union
of gametic pronuclei within the same cell, without conjugation, could substitute for
conjugation in preventing senescence in protozoa70.
Bell has interpreted senescence in protozoa as being caused by the irreversible accumu-
lation of deleterious mutations in isolate lines and not as some adaptive response.
However, it is possible that senescence offers a selective advantage to populations of pro-
tozoa. Indeed, Cui et al. used computer simulation to analyze two hypothetical species of
protozoa, one with and one without senescence71. The two species were subject to the
same rate of deleterious mutation and could undergo ﬁssion or conjugation. Conjugation
was assumed to re-set the clock,whereas senescence would eliminate an individual reach-
ing its age limit.The results of the simulation indicated that far fewer recessive deleterious
mutations had accumulated in the species employing senescence. The authors speculated
that senescence had emerged as an effective way of interrupting the pathway of mutation
accumulation increasing the chance of sexual reproduction to produce high-ﬁtness off-
spring. In this case, senescence has been explained as offering an advantage in combina-
tion with sexual reproduction. This would be in keeping with the more general idea that
aging is the price we have to pay for sex, which is almost certainly false because, as out-
lined above, aging is not a major cause of mortality in natural animal populations72.
However,senescence in protozoa is not necessarily identical to aging in mammals and it is
certainly possible that the process has some adaptive value (see further below). It should
be noted that Bell argued against senescence in protozoa as an adaptive response since the
onset of senescent changes is highly variable between independent cultures in contrast to
the onset of sexual maturation, which is invariant.
The basis of any discussion of mutation accumulation is the realization that in living
organisms genetic information cannot be transmitted without error. In a ﬁnite asexual
population deleterious mutations will accumulate over time because sooner or later those
cells harboring the least mutations will be extinguished and cannot be restored.This phe-
nomenon, called Muller’s ratchet73, is responsible for senescence in isolated cultures of
protozoa and sets a limit to the longevity of germ lines. Sex would then act as a repair
THE LOGIC OF AGING
35

device for acquired mutations by re-shufﬂing genomes, effectively resulting in some
genomes with low mutation loads. As explained by Bell, while this protection would be
most effective during cross-fertilization, also autogamy will offer some protection, which
explains the result obtained by Sonneborn, mentioned above.
It should be realized that population extinction by Muller’s ratchet (germinal senes-
cence) is essentially different from the concept of aging genes resulting from the accumu-
lation of mutations in the germ line. As pointed out by Bell, the germ line ages because it
accumulates mutations adversely affecting fertility.This can effectively terminate a popu-
lation. The soma of multicellular organisms ages because selection will not cleanse their
genome of genes with adverse effects on the soma at late age. Nevertheless, the ratchet
would operate in all genomes over time and there is no reason to assume that it would not
operate in somatic cells of metazoa,especially stem cells which would readily develop into
clonal lines creating mosaics for the mutations which have arisen.This situation would be
analogous to senescence of a protozoan clone, but signiﬁcantly more complicated in view
of the interdependence of different types of somatic cells in metazoan species.
In summary,Medawar’s idea of aging as a result of the accumulation in the germ line of
mutations creating gene variants with adverse effects on the soma late in life, after the age
of ﬁrst reproduction, is a logical explanation for the sheer universality of aging in the
animal world. Such a random process of evolving aging genes suggests that aging is
affected by many genes, each with a relatively small effect. This would make aging inﬁ-
nitely complex and different from species to species. While aging is indeed characterized
by randomness, with variation within and between species the rule, this explanation is
still unsatisfactory since it does not address the great similarities in the types of aging
processes that are also a characteristic of aging in animals.
2.2 Pleiotropy in aging
The evolutionary logic of the Medawar theory begs the question of the type of aging genes
we should be looking for when trying to identify the mechanisms that control aging and
longevity. Before discussing this it is important to clarify what we mean by aging genes.
First, Medawar’s accidental mutations in the germ line are not necessarily in genes, but
could be in DNA sequences that control the expression of genes.Second,as should be clear
from the discussion above, there are no genes speciﬁcally selected to cause aging. Instead,
most aging genes are variants of genes or DNA sequences that have adverse effects after the
age of ﬁrst reproduction. Finally, as discussed in Chapter 1, genes do not act alone, but in
functional modules, which arise from interactions among components in the cell (pro-
teins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules). This context should be kept in mind every time
the term aging gene is used.
36
THE LOGIC OF AGING

George Martin has distinguished private from public aging genes74.Private aging genes
ﬁnd their origin in Medawar’s accidental germ-line mutations discussed above,which are
neutral at early age, but start exerting their adverse effects later, after the period of ﬁrst
reproduction. In the absence of selection, the frequency of such mutations in the popula-
tion would be determined by genetic drift. They will, therefore, be relatively rare and can
also be expected to be speciﬁc for the population or species in which they arise. Hence,
they were termed private aging genes. J.B.S. Haldane predicted such genes in the 1940s
based on his observation that Huntington’s disease, a genetic disorder, occurs late in life,
after most people have already had their children.
Apart from Huntington’s disease, in humans private aging genes could explain familial
forms of age-related disease phenotypes, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Martin systemati-
cally analyzed known loci involved in human genetic disease, which had been cataloged
by Victor McKusick (Baltimore, MD, USA) as Mendelian Inheritance of Man (a pheno-
typic companion to the HGP and available online as OMIM; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
entrez/query.fcgi?dbOMIM). Based on these phenotypic descriptions, Martin con-
cluded that private mutations at a very large number of loci could play a causal role in the
senescent phenotypes as they are observed among elderly75.
In contrast to private aging genes, public aging genes are hypothesized to have arisen
under the inﬂuence of natural selection,not because they cause aging but as a consequence
of an early, beneﬁcial effect. Their adverse by-products would only become manifest at
later age. This involves the concept of antagonistic pleiotropy and was originally proposed
by George Williams76. Since we know that genes usually have more than one effect (hence
the term pleiotropy) it is more than likely that the same applies to the gene variants arising
as accidental mutations.Since most mutations are bad,it would be unlikely that in the rare
case of a beneﬁcial effect of an accidental germ-line mutation early in life there would not
be an adverse effect later. In this view, aging would be the result of the harmful side effects
of genes selected for advantages they offered during youth. It is possible that there are
many such trade-offs between early and late effects and, in contrast to Medawar’s deleteri-
ous mutations, which are neutral at early age, pleiotropic mutations could involve con-
served mechanisms of universal beneﬁt. Indeed, mutational variants of genes affecting
similar functions early in life could have arisen independently in different populations,
and even in different, only distantly related species. For this reason one can refer to such
evolutionarily conserved genes as public aging genes. A few theoretical examples under-
score the existence of the trade-offs dictated by public aging genes.
To illustrate his pleiotropic gene theory of aging, Williams himself provided the ﬁrst
example, in the form of an arising gene variant with a favorable effect on bone calciﬁca-
tion in the developmental period with the adverse side effect of depositions of calcium in
the arterial walls at later ages76. As noted above, as an unfavorable character, senescence
would always evoke direct action of selection to oppose it.Hence,additional gene variants
would likely arise to suppress the adverse phenotype of calcium deposition in arterial
THE LOGIC OF AGING
37

walls (if environmental constraints permit). However, this mechanism would never
succeed in suppressing the adverse trait completely due to diminishing selective pressure
with age.Another example of a trade-off that may explain human aging-related disease is
inﬂammation. Genetic pathways specifying a powerful response to infection have
undoubtedly a high survival value, but may at later age contribute to disease-causing
degeneration, such as atherosclerosis77.
One could think of a large number of trade-offs in gene action, reﬂecting on age-
related disease phenotypes.Cancer is one of them.Tumor-suppressor genes are obviously
advantageous for young organisms and mutations inactivating such genes would not be
passed on to many offspring. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and cellular senes-
cence,irreversible mitotic arrest,are both critical processes for suppressing tumorigenesis
in mammals78. Both responses are highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms also for rea-
sons other than suppressing cancer. Apoptosis, for example, plays an essential role in
embryonic development and also later in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. As
ﬁrst realized by Judith Campisi (Berkeley, CA, USA), in mammals both apoptosis and
cellular senescence are likely to be antagonistically pleiotropic,since they help to suppress
cancer at early age, but possibly at the cost of promoting aging at later ages by exhausting
progenitor- or stem-cell reservoirs79. This possible antagonism between cancer and 
non-cancer degenerative aging phenotypes will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
Another example of antagonistic pleiotropy could be the production of ATP by oxida-
tive phosphorylation, the main pathway of energy production. This effective method of
harnessing energy arose early in evolution and has been conserved with relatively minor
variation. However, cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products of oxida-
tive phosphorylation and I already mentioned in Chapter 1 that it was Denham Harman
who originally hypothesized that such free radicals are one of the major factors responsi-
ble for the aging of cells23.Since the accumulated damage from ROS usually only becomes
manifest at late age, this could be another example of postponing adverse effects of a
beneﬁcial pathway. Like other processes of a conserved beneﬁcial nature, genes control-
ling oxidative phosphorylation can be considered as public aging genes.
Probably the most ancient,hypothetical example of antagonistic pleiotropy is the com-
plex of intertwined pathways to replicate,recombine,and repair DNA or,originally,RNA.
While these systems guarantee life’s continuity, there is a price in the form of the double-
edged sword of mutations, the result of erroneous DNA transactions. Mutations are nec-
essary as the ultimate source of genetic variation upon which evolution depends,yet most
of them are harmful.We have already seen that mutations with late-life adverse effects but
which are neutral at early age are likely to accumulate in the germ line. A high rate of
germ-line mutation can lead to population extinction, which may have been the driving
force behind the evolution of sex, mate choice, and diploid life cycles, all ways to limit the
adverse effects of mutations. Since the adverse effects of mutations in somatic cells would
only become manifest at late age, selection to improve the accuracy of DNA metabolism
far beyond the age of ﬁrst reproduction is absent.
38
THE LOGIC OF AGING

Antagonistic pleiotropy can also act directly on reproductive success (sexual selection)
rather than on the ability to deal with environmental factors (survival selection). Indeed,
lower fecundity is often found associated with longevity, such as in the aforementioned
insular opossum population experiencing the least extrinsic mortality63.The importance of
sexual selection is further underscored by a series of experiments reported by Sgro and
Partridge80, the results of which elegantly demonstrated that antagonistic pleiotropy is
likely to be more frequently responsible for aging phenotypes than Medawar’s neutral
mutations.In long- and short-lived lines of fruit ﬂies,generated by making these ﬂies repro-
duce late or very early (see above), Sgro and Partridge initially observed similar mortality.
However, after 30 days, the short-lived lines, with eggs laid by very young adults, experi-
enced a wave of higher mortality,which did not occur in the ﬂies selected to live for longer80.
Interestingly, this wave of higher mortality, causing the early reproducers to age quickly,
could be abrogated by the ablation of egg laying, for example through irradiation. Hence,
rather than late, adverse effects of mutations neutral at early age, these results suggest a
damaging effect of early reproduction. Selection for life extension could be the result of a
switch in resource allocation, from reproduction to somatic maintenance. Alternatively,
early reproduction could have caused the damage directly with the effects accumulating
over time, to result in the wave of mortality. In spite of this elegant experimental example
of antagonistic pleiotropy in action, with sexual selection as the possible driver, an inverse
relationship between fecundity and longevity is complex and not always found81.
In summary, aging genes are not considered to have emerged on the basis of some
selected value for ﬁtness but are merely by-products of evolution. They are thought to
dictate trade-offs between beneﬁcial effects early in life and adverse effects later. In the
next section we will discuss several examples of such genes.An adverse effect of any aging
gene can be suppressed by another gene, which we can call longevity genes or longevity-
assurance genes. It is conceivable that the emergence of aging genes and longevity genes
go hand in hand, under the inﬂuence of environmental constraints. Although the exis-
tence of a large number of private genes, specifying aging mechanisms peculiar to certain
species and to certain individuals within a species, cannot be ruled out, evidence points
towards a major role of public mechanisms specifying highly conserved beneﬁcial path-
ways, such as oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis. This is in keeping with the many
similarities of aging within and across species and, based on the ancestry of some univer-
sal pathways of life, opens up the possibility that aging has been with us from early times.
2.3 Interrupting the pathways of aging
One way to identify aging genes and their mechanisms of action would be to screen a
population for individuals harboring inactivating or weakening mutations in a gene
controlling a pathway of aging.This would work well for Medawar’s gene variants that are
THE LOGIC OF AGING
39

neutral at young age and also for Williams’ pleiotropic gene variants when depriving the
individual of an early beneﬁcial effect that is not lethal under the conditions the animal is
studied. The latter may be difﬁcult in mammals with their complicated genomes harbor-
ing numerous gene–gene interactions that can easily lead to adverse side effects. As we
will see, most of the aging genes thus far identiﬁed have indeed been found in relatively
simple invertebrates, although large-scale genetic screens are of course also much easier
to perform in short-lived simple organisms than in mice or rats.
Whereas it was previously recognized that many single-gene mutants could shorten
lifespan, a major increase in lifespan due to the effect of one gene was considered unlikely
in view of the presumed multicausal nature of the aging process. This does not mean that
mechanisms to delay aging and extend lifespan were not known. As described further
below, the phenomenon of extending lifespan through calorie restriction has been
known since the 1930s and the effect of temperature and reproductive status on lifespan
of Drosophila was described as early as the 1920s by Raymond Pearl (1879–1940).Indeed,
John Maynard Smith (1920–2004) was probably the ﬁrst to describe an increase in
lifespan due to the effect of a single-gene mutation in Drosophila. He found that the
ovariless mutant (a mutant where the females entirely lack ovaries) as well as virgin or
partially heat-sterilized females have extended survival compared to controls82. However,
these results were not generalized in terms of the existence of many genes that could be
manipulated to alter functional pathways controlling longevity.It is now well understood
that single-gene mutants can affect a host of downstream processes and therefore
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence major prolongevity systems. This is the basis of the wealth of long-
lived mutants that have now been discovered in nematodes, fruit ﬂies, and, more recently,
in mice83.
2.3.1 THE NEMATODE WORM, C. ELEGANS
The mutant gene that transformed this ﬁeld by its demonstrated pro-longevity effect in
the nematode was ﬁrst identiﬁed in the laboratory of Tom Johnson (Boulder,CO,USA)50,
who called it age-1. Later, this gene turned out to encode the C. elegans ortholog of the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110 catalytic subunit, a central component of the C. elegans
insulin-like signaling pathway, lying downstream of the DAF-2/insulin receptor (see
below) and upstream of both the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1)
and thymoma viral proto-oncogenes 1 and 2 (AKT-1/AKT-2 kinases) and the DAF-16
forkhead-type transcription factor, whose negative regulation is the key output of the
insulin signaling pathway84 (see below).
Cynthia Kenyon (San Francisco, CA, USA) and co-workers subsequently demon-
strated that mutations in daf-2 also conferred longevity to the worm85.This gene was later
identiﬁed in the laboratory of Gary Ruvkin (Boston, MA, USA) as a insulin/insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor homolog, thus acting (upstream) in the same pathway
40
THE LOGIC OF AGING

as age-186. Loss-of-function mutations in these genes and others acting in these pathways
cause dauer formation, a state of diapause in response to food limitation and crowding.
Weak mutations in such genes,however,allow these animals to become adults and live up
to twice their normal lifespan. It appeared that the diapause-related genes confer their
longevity-promoting effects through the action of a forkhead/winged helix transcription
factor called DAF-16, identiﬁed independently by the Kenyon and Ruvkin labs87,88. DAF-
16 relocates from the cytoplasm into the nuclei of different cell types in the nematode and
affects the activities of genes involved in many processes, including metabolism, stress
response, and antimicrobial action89. Indeed, it is possible that the mechanism underly-
ing the increased longevity of these and other mutants in different organisms involves the
upregulation of longevity-assurance mechanisms (see below).
The Kenyon lab also found that germ-line ablation increases the lifespan of nematodes90,
similar to what has been found in Drosophila (see above).While this effect is independent
of the upstream daf-2 gene, its signal does activate daf-16. DAF-16, therefore may be a
master regulator integrating different longevity signals.
Among genes conferring longevity on the nematode upon mutational inactivation or
weakening, those that impact on mitochondrial function are especially frequent.
Examples are the clk genes, so-called because they regulate physiological, developmental,
and behavioral clocks during the nematode life cycle. Four clk mutants have been identi-
ﬁed that show a moderate increase in lifespan91. CLK-1 has been shown to localize in the
mitochondria of all somatic cells of the worm and is required for the biosynthesis of
coenzyme Q992.Coenzyme Q plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial electron-transport
chain, and clk-1 mutants rely on the Q8 homolog of Q9 synthesized by the worm’s diet of
E. coli. Withdrawal of Q8 from the diet of wild-type nematodes extends adult lifespan by
approximately 60%, probably by decreasing the release of free radicals from mitochon-
dria or by increasing resistance to damage accumulation93.
The ﬁrst lifespan-extending mutations were discovered in nematodes in classical
genetic screens, by mutagenizing worms to randomly disrupt gene function and subse-
quently recover long-lived mutants. However, with the emergence of the novel, high-
throughput methods in functional genomics a more systematic approach became
possible,which was quickly utilized by the main players in this by now highly competitive
ﬁeld. To identify in a systematic manner the different classes of genes that control 
C.eleganslifespan,both the Kenyon and Ruvkin labs began to apply the new RNAi approach
(Chapter 1). Using so-called feeding RNAi libraries—that is, by feeding worms with
bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA—over 17 000 nematode genes were screened
by these investigators94,95. A number of known and unknown genes—as many as 89 in
one of these studies—were found that extended nematode lifespan upon RNAi inactiva-
tion. Many of these genes turned out to encode components of the mitochondrial respi-
ratory chain or were impacting mitochondrial function. Thus, the results obtained with
this comprehensive RNAi screen conﬁrm the idea that mutations that extend lifespan
often involve genes participating in energy metabolism.
THE LOGIC OF AGING
41

2.3.2 THE FRUIT FLY, D. MELANOGASTER
As expected from public aging pathways, when the interruption of a pathway leads to
extended lifespan in one species, interruption of orthologous pathways in other species
should give similar results. This has proved to be the case for the insulin/IGF-1 signaling
pathway. As we have seen, reducing the activity of this pathway increases lifespan in the
nematode. In Drosophila, complete inactivation of the gene that encodes the insulin
receptor substrate (IRS) homolog (chico) extends lifespan by about 45%, but only in
females. Heterozygous individuals of both sexes lived longer. There is also evidence that
in chico mutants the longevity phenotype is associated with increased stress resistance.
Similarly, hypomorph mutations in the insulin-like receptor (InR) gene extend the
lifespan of females, but not of males52. In this case there is evidence that the longevity
phenotype in the females is associated with infertility.
Another aging pathway identiﬁed in Drosophila on the basis of mutants of increased
lifespan is the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, which has now emerged as a major
regulator of growth and size, as well as longevity96. Inhibition of this nutrient-sensing
pathway,which can modulate insulin signaling and growth,extends lifespan in the ﬂy in a
manner that may overlap with caloric restriction; that is, a reduction in nutrient intake
increasing lifespan across different taxa.
Two partial loss-of-function mutations have been described in the ﬂy, namely
Methuselah (mth) and I’m not dead yet (indy), which increase lifespan by 30 and 100%,
respectively. The effect is seen in both male and female ﬂies without loss of fertility.
However,the indy mutation only increases lifespan in the heterozygote ﬂies.The mth gene
encodes a G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptor97. In addition, mutations in the
gene for its ligand, Stunted (sun), which encodes a subunit of ATP synthase, increase
lifespan98.Whereas Stunted is found on the cell surface,the Methuselah–Stunted pathway
may exert its role as a regulator of aging through the mitochondria. The indy gene
encodes a dicarboxylate transporter, a membrane protein that transports Krebs-cycle
intermediates in tissues participating in the uptake, utilization, and storage of nutrients.
The life-extending effect of the Indy mutation may be due to an alteration in energy
balance caused by a decrease in Indy transport function99.
2.3.3 CALORIE RESTRICTION
Well before it was realized that single gene mutations could slow the rate of aging and
increase lifespan in invertebrates, Clive McCay (1898–1967) reported in 1935 his unex-
pected discovery that rats that ate less lived nearly 30% longer100. Calorie or caloric
restriction, as this is generally called, is underfeeding without malnutrition. Work from
others,most notably a series of careful studies by Edward Masoro (San Antonio,TX,USA),
42
THE LOGIC OF AGING

subsequently demonstrated convincingly that reduced caloric intake rather than reduc-
tion of a speciﬁc nutrient was responsible for the beneﬁcial effects, which also included a
reduction or retardation of tumor formation and other aging-related phenotypes101.
Importantly, a signiﬁcant effect was still seen when calorie restriction in the mouse was
initiated as late as 12 months of age102.Calorie restriction is unrelated to development since
there was no effect when applied early, between 6 and 24 weeks in the rat103. Rodents on a
calorie-restriction regimen have lower fasting levels of plasma glucose,insulin,and IGF-1.
This suggests that decreased insulin signaling, similar to the situation in some of the long-
lived nematode and ﬂy mutants, could also contribute to the calorie-restriction longevity
effect.Life extension through caloric restriction has been observed not only in rodents,but
also in various species of worms, ﬂies, and yeast. Studies to test whether similar effects can
be found in primates are still under way104.
Calorie restriction is often assumed to be caused by a lower metabolic rate (rate of
energy utilization), often thought to promote longevity. The idea that aging is inversely
related to metabolic rate goes back to a publication by Max Rubner (1854–1932) in
1908 showing for ﬁve mammalian species that in spite of large differences in lifespan
total metabolic output (the amount of energy consumed during adult life) per unit
body weight was similar105. The conclusion was that animals with a high metabolic
rate would have a shorter lifespan than animals with lower rates. Raymond Pearl
(1879–1940) subsequently presented his rate of living theory based on survival experi-
ments with Drosophila and cantaloupe seedlings106. His conclusions were that an
organism’s duration of life is determined by its ‘inherent vitality’. Inherent vitality
was deﬁned by Pearl as the total capacity of the organism to perform vital action in 
the complete absence of exogenous energy; under conditions of complete starvation.
Inherent vitality is then lost at a rate that equals the rate of energy expenditure. Lifespan,
therefore, is inversely related to the rate of living. Naturally, it is tempting to link
metabolic rate to natural free-radical production and the accumulation of somatic
damage as originally conceived by Harman23. Indeed, there is ample evidence that
calorie restriction retards the accumulation of oxidatively damaged molecules in aging
rodents107.
Whereas metabolic alterations are likely to play a role in both caloric restriction and the
longevity phenotype of most if not all the long-lived mutants in worms and ﬂies, varia-
tion in lifespan appeared not to be attributable to reduced metabolic rate. For example,
whereas in rodents immediately after the initiation of calorie restriction metabolic rate
rapidly declines, it is subsequently restored and stays the same per lean body mass, as in
control animals108. In ﬂies and worms, calorie-restriction-induced life extension is not
associated with a lower metabolic rate and the same is true for the longevity phenotypes
of the insulin-signaling mutants of these invertebrate species109–111.This does not rule out
the possibility of metabolic alterations facilitating a reduced formation of reactive oxygen
molecules.
THE LOGIC OF AGING
43

2.3.4 GENETIC MANIPULATION OF LIFESPAN IN MICE
Naturally, genetic screens for longevity mutants are difﬁcult to carry out in mammals
because of their long generation times and expensive husbandry. On the other hand, they
offer the enormous advantages that they are evolutionarily very close to humans and that
lifetime phenotypic information on mice and rats is extensive (albeit not as complete as
for humans). Studies of some spontaneous and engineered mutants suggest that mecha-
nisms similar to those acting in nematodes and fruit ﬂies also control longevity in mam-
mals. Mice homozygous for mutations in the Prop-1 gene, termed Ames dwarf mice, are
dwarfs and live 50–70% longer than wild-type mice112. These animals are deﬁcient in
growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin, and they show
reduced levels of plasma insulin,IGF-1,and glucose.They also show a delayed occurrence
of neoplastic lesions compared with their normal siblings113.
Expression of the Pit-1 gene, which controls development of the pituitary gland,
depends on expression of the Prop-1 gene. Pit-1-defective mice, termed Snell dwarf mice,
are dwarfs and infertile like Ames mice, and they show a 40% increase in mean and maxi-
mum lifespan114. They also show a delay in collagen cross-linking with age and several
age-sensitive indices of immune status. In Snell mice, evidence has been provided for
reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling in response to the GH deﬁciency115,which could be a key
factor in the lifespan extension of these mice, as it apparently is in longevity mutants of
nematodes and ﬂies and, possibly, in calorie restriction. Of note, both natural and engi-
neered GH-defective mice show increased longevity and have also very low circulating
IGF-1114,116. Interestingly, like the longevity mutants in nematodes and ﬂies, both dwarf
mice and calorie-restricted mice display increased resistance to stress, pointing towards
an upregulation of longevity systems (see further below).
Reduced insulin signaling as a universal mechanism for delayed aging of mice is in keep-
ing with the increased lifespan of female mice haploinsufﬁcient for the IGF-1 receptor117,
although this ﬁnding has thus far not been reproduced independently. Interestingly, both
male and female mice with a disruption of the insulin receptor gene only in adipose tissue
show a decreased body fat mass and increased longevity118.These mice live longer with nor-
mal caloric intake and retain leanness and glucose tolerance with age. While it is tempting
to suggest that based on this ﬁnding it is leanness rather than metabolic changes that causes
the extension of life,it should be realized that as argued by Masoro119 the elimination of the
insulin receptor in fat would by itself lead to changes in metabolism. Indeed, reduced fat
is not involved in the mechanism behind the phenomenon of calorie restriction. This can
be derived from results obtained by David Harrison (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and col-
leagues120, who studied the effects of life-long calorie restriction in genetically obese (ob/ob)
and normal mice of the same inbred strain.While the calorie-restricted ob/ob mice still had
high levels of adiposity,their maximum lifespan exceeded that of the normal mice and was
similar to the lifespan of calorie-restricted normal mice that were much leaner120.
44
THE LOGIC OF AGING

Interestingly,there have been attempts to mimic some of the lifespan-extending mutations
in nematodes by targeted inactivation of orthologs of the same genes that conferred
longevity in these invertebrate animals. Siegfried Hekimi (Montreal, Canada), who had
previously discovered the clk-1 mechanism of lifespan extension in nematodes (see above),
inactivated the clk-1 ortholog,mClk1,in the mouse121.It was found that homozygous inac-
tivation of this gene (which is required for the synthesis of coenzyme Q9; see above) in
mouse embryonic stem cells yielded cells that are protected from oxidative stress and con-
tain lower levels of spontaneous DNA damage. Whereas the complete mClk1 knockout is
embryonically lethal, the heterozygous mice showed an increased lifespan. Interestingly,
these investigators observed the loss of the remaining functioning allele of mClk1 during
aging in a subset of liver cells, as a consequence of so-called loss of heterozygosity; that is,
through the loss of the chromosome or section of the chromosome (see Chapter 4).
2.3.5 INTERRUPTING AGING OR BACK TO NORMAL?
The current wealth of mutants of extended lifespan in various organisms appears to
conﬁrm that, as predicted by the antagonistic pleiotropy theory, there are genetic path-
ways that can be interrupted to attenuate aging. It would be logical to expect that such
mutations would only lengthen life at the cost of some selective disadvantage, which may
or may not be obvious under laboratory conditions. Typically, mutations conferring
longevity result in decreased energy metabolism, growth, physical activity, and/or early-
life fecundity. It is likely that such characteristics are not usually the preferred ones in
nature with its high external mortality. For the dwarf mice,ﬁtness costs are readily appar-
ent in the form of infertility and hypothyroidism. Weak or sick nematodes or ﬂies may
not always be so easily recognizable, but as demonstrated by Gordon Lithgow (Novato,
CA, USA) and co-workers, even under laboratory conditions, partial loss of function of
DAF-2 results in dramatically reduced ﬁtness as compared to wild-type worms122.
However, a number of mutants have been described for which a price to be paid for
longevity was not immediately obvious.For such mutants it is conceivable that in the wild
there would be a strong selection in favor of the wild-type allele. It is now clear that this
may indeed be the case. For example, the age-1 mutation in nematodes, which affects the
same pathway as daf-2, shows no obvious effects on ﬁtness under standard laboratory
conditions. However, the Lithgow lab exposed mixtures of age-1 mutant and wild-type
worms to more natural conditions: cycles of starvation, which are quite common in the
wild.A large reduction in the frequency of the mutant allele suggested a substantial differ-
ence in relative ﬁtness, which explains the selection of the wild-type allele123.
The strong effect of laboratory conditions on the uncovering of aging genes naturally
begs the question of whether such ‘laboratory’ genes reﬂect genuine pro-aging pathways,
acting under natural conditions, or are merely artifacts. It is far from sure that loci with
THE LOGIC OF AGING
45

major effects on longevity in laboratory strains of various species will show segregating
allelic variation in natural populations. Indeed, even if we adopt the premise that the
basic mechanisms that control longevity and determine the rate of aging are common to
all multicellular organisms, it is possible that the observed effects on longevity of candi-
date gene variants will prove to be exclusively associated with laboratory strains and not
found in the same animals in the wild. Common laboratory situations generally select for
high early fecundity and shorten the lifespan of the organisms under study. For example,
Richard Miller (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and Steve Austad (San Antonio, TX, USA) com-
pared wild-derived mice with laboratory mice of a mixed genetic background and found
signiﬁcantly higher mean and maximum lifespans in the wild mice. Therefore, studies
that use laboratory organisms to identify aging-related pathways might identify genes
that simply restore the organism’s original lifespan. Such results may not be fully relevant
to wild populations124,125. In this respect, even the beneﬁts of calorie restriction—still the
only intervention that seems to increase longevity in a large number of species—may be
exclusively associated with laboratory animals, which in the wild would forage continu-
ously and endure cycles of starvation. It is conceivable that calorie restriction is the norm
in wild populations of mice126. The only valid strategy to test the possibility that genetic
variation at candidate loci contributes naturally to phenotypic variance for longevity and
aging phenotypes is to demonstrate such associations in the wild (see also Chapter 7).
Nevertheless, the discovery of pathways that appear to control aging rate through a syn-
chronized retardation of multiple aging processes is obviously of extreme importance.
It suggests that the underlying causes of aging may not be as diverse as often suspected.
2.3.6 HOW DO AGING GENES CAUSE AGING?
How could mutations that lead to mild inhibition of growth, reproduction and energy
metabolism readily retard aging? We have already seen that many of these aging genes
direct trade-offs, which greatly depend on the environmental conditions. Based on the
available evidence, a logical explanation would be that the activities of such pro-aging
pathways are associated with either an increased generation of somatic damage or a
reduced investment in somatic repair and maintenance. In keeping with the theory of
antagonistic pleiotropy, it is easy to see why gene variants promoting growth and repro-
duction are generally favored by evolution, even if their activity would lead to a more
rapid rate of somatic damage and a shorter lifespan. Under optimal conditions, investing
more in growth and reproduction is a sure bet, taking the ordinary environmental risks
into consideration. However, there are situations where reducing growth and reproduc-
tion does offer some selective advantage. For example, under certain conditions, such as
famine, it would help the organism to shut off reproduction and put all the resources in
somatic maintenance and survival. This is exactly what happens when nematodes enter
46
THE LOGIC OF AGING

the so-called dauer stage, a growth-arrested, stress-resistant stage, analogous to spore
formation in bacteria or protozoa or hibernation in vertebrates. Such shifts in allocation
of resources from growth and reproduction to somatic maintenance and repair are pre-
dicted by the disposable soma theory (see above).
Are pathways related to growth and reproduction the only candidate aging pathways?
Whereas it is certainly possible that all aging pathways may fall into these functional cate-
gories, at this stage it is impossible to rule out the existence of other, functionally unre-
lated pathways. Unfortunately, we will never know because reducing beneﬁcial activities
of pathways at early age might be lethal or cause major developmental defects. However,
an alternative to genetic screening in ﬁnding aging genes and pathways has now emerged
in the form of various computational approaches. As we have seen in Chapter 1, genes
and proteins exert their physiological functions as networks of interaction rather than
individually. In protein–protein interaction networks, or interactome networks, most
proteins interact with few partners, whereas a small but signiﬁcant proportion of pro-
teins,the so-called hubs,interact with many partners.Such networks are called scale-free,
which is the norm in cellular networks. Scale-free networks are particularly resistant to
random node removal but are extremely sensitive to the targeted removal of hubs127.
Daniel Promislow (Athens,GA,USA) compared patterns of connectivity for subsets of
yeast proteins associated with senescence. He found that proteins associated with aging
have signiﬁcantly higher connectivity than expected by chance,even when controlling for
other factors also associated with connectivity, such as localization of protein expression
within the cell128. Similar observations were made by others129 and are consistent with the
antagonistic pleiotropy theory for the evolution of senescence. Importantly, they offer an
in silico tool to discover new aging genes. However, it should be realized that such in silico
approaches are still in their infancy. For example, also on the basis of protein–protein
interactions in yeast, it has been suggested that the most highly connected proteins are
essential genes130. However, recent results on such networks in mammals (assembled on
the basis of interaction data derived from the literature) suggested no such correlation
between highly connected genes and lethality of these genes when ablated in either mouse
or yeast131. As more complete protein network data are now becoming available for
multiple organisms these issues will be resolved and it is certainly conceivable that future
in silicosearches will either conﬁrm that all aging genes are involved in some aspect of growth,
reproduction,and energy metabolism or uncover other,unrelated pleiotropic genes.
2.4 Longevity-assurance genes
If aging is the result of the harmful side effects of genes selected for advantages they offer
during youth, such effects can be suppressed by the action of other genes, which we can
THE LOGIC OF AGING
47

call longevity genes or longevity-assurance genes. As mentioned above, it is conceivable
that the emergence of aging genes and longevity genes goes hand in hand,under the inﬂu-
ence of environmental constraints. Longevity genes promote or ensure organismal sur-
vival without necessarily playing a direct role in development or maturation. They may
encode components of stress-response systems that have apparently evolved to postpone
adverse effects associated with endogenous or environmental sources of macromolecular
damage. Longevity genes may be highly conserved since endogenous and environmental
damage is ubiquitous in all living systems. In particular, DNA-repair systems are ancient,
since from the ﬁrst replicators all living organisms had to cope with agents damaging
their nucleic acids (see below and Chapter 4).
As already mentioned, regulation of stress-response mechanisms is almost universally
associated with increased lifespan. In the nematode, it has been demonstrated that the
upregulation of DAF-16 in insulin/IGF-1 mutants affects expression of genes that
increase resistance to environmental stress, including the ability to detoxify ROS, which
could be the mechanism underlying the increased longevity of these mutants. Indeed, of
the more than 40 single-gene mutants in C. elegans that display increased longevity, all
increase the ability of the worm to respond to certain types of stress, for example heat,
ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and ROS132. One longevity gene, which encodes the OLD-1
transmembrane tyrosine kinase, is stress-inducible and increases longevity by its overex-
pression. The expression of OLD-1 appears to be dependent on DAF-16 and is required
for the lifespan extension of age-1 and daf-2 mutants133.
Among various stress responses the heat-shock response has received special attention
in view of the capacity of heat-shock proteins to protect cells against protein aggregation.
Protein aggregation is caused by disruption of protein-folding homeostasis, which in
turn has several possible causes, including oxidative damage, heat, and some forms of
genome instability. Heat-shock genes encode chaperones to prevent this and other types
of adverse effect (see Chapter 4 for a more detailed discussion of chaperones). Extra
copies of the gene encoding the heat-shock protein HSP-16 conferred stress resistance
and longevity in the nematode134. Also in this case, the DAF-16 transcription factor was
essential for lifespan extension conferred by hsp-16.
Overexpression of heat-shock factor (HSF-1), a transcriptional regulator of heat-
shock genes, increased longevity by about 20%135. Inactivation of hsf-1, but also inactiva-
tion of daf-16,accelerated the aggregation of polyglutamine expansion proteins136.As will
be discussed in more detail in the next chapter, such aggregation is often caused by the
ampliﬁcation of small triplet repeats in the DNA, a form of genomic instability. Hence,
these results suggest that DAF-16 and HSF-1 both act to prevent or attenuate the effects of
such genome-instability events.Although daf-16 was required for hsf-1 overexpression to
extend lifespan,HSF-1 can function independently of DAF-16136.What this tells us is that
upregulation of longevity genes, such as daf-16 or hsf-1, per se is sufﬁcient to increase
lifespan.This does not rule out the possibility that the targets of some of these genes are to
48
THE LOGIC OF AGING

be found in metabolism with the explicit purpose of reducing molecular damage at the
source rather than ﬁxing its consequences.
In addition Drosophila longevity mutants, such as Methuselah, were found to display
enhanced resistance to heat, oxidants, and starvation97. In the ﬂy, increased expression of
genes involved in protein repair—those encoding protein carboxymethyltransferase and
methionine sulfoxide reductase—increase lifespan137,138. Heightened activity of the
antioxidant enzymes CuZn- and Mn-superoxide dismutase has also been demonstrated
to increase longevity in this organism139,140.Hence,in both nematodes and ﬂies,increased
lifespan is caused by increased resistance to stress, either orchestrated in response to
reduced growth and energy metabolism, or engineered by manipulating the longevity
genes themselves.
In the mouse there is also convincing evidence that both the dwarf longevity mutants
and mice subjected to calorie restriction display increased resistance to stress, including
antioxidant defense, DNA repair, and heat shock141,142. Interestingly, results from Richard
Miller and co-workers143 indicate that the increased resistance to stress in the dwarf mice
can be demonstrated at the level of skin ﬁbroblasts in culture. Such cells are resistant to
multiple forms of cellular stress, including UV light, heat, paraquat, H2O2, and cad-
mium143,144. Recent results from my own laboratory indicate that dwarf mice show a
signiﬁcantly lower rate of mutation accumulation with age. To detect spontaneous muta-
tions in different organs and tissues of these mice, Ana Maria Garcia, a postdoctoral
researcher in the laboratory, crossed a transgenic mouse harboring a lacZ-plasmid
reporter construct in its germ line into the homozygous Ames dwarf background. By
recovering the lacZ plasmids from genomic DNA of the hybrids and their wild-type litter-
mate controls she was able to compare the mutation frequencies at the reporter locus (for
a description of this system see Chapter 6). The results indicate a signiﬁcantly lower
mutation frequency in dwarf mice than in controls. She also subjected these mice to
caloric restriction and demonstrated that this also reduced spontaneous mutation fre-
quency, albeit to a lesser extent than dwarﬁsm (Fig. 2.4). These results are in keeping with
the delayed occurrence of total neoplastic lesions observed in Ames dwarf mice,which is a
major contributing factor to the extended lifespan of these animals113.
One reason why mutations conferring lifespan extension based on the inhibition of
growth and reproduction show up so readily in a genetic screen could be the selective
advantage of mechanisms to delay reproduction and increase survival, as originally pro-
posed by Harrison and Archer145 and Holliday146 to explain the phenomenon of caloric
restriction. While the possibility to temporarily halt or attenuate growth and reproduc-
tion would be advantageous, actual mutants with continuously downregulated insulin
signaling would not survive for many generations, as we have seen from the results
obtained by Lithgow (see above). What could be the mechanism underlying the upregu-
lation of multiple longevity genes as a consequence of reducing growth and metabolism?
To bridge the gap between metabolism and somatic maintenance, Leonard Guarente
THE LOGIC OF AGING
49

(Cambridge, MA, USA) proposed another master regulator, this time the silencing infor-
mation regulator 2 (Sir2). Sir2 is the founding member of a phylogenetically conserved
family of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylases
(HDACs), called sirtuins147. Sir2 is required for transcriptional silencing—transcrip-
tional inactivation by altering chromatin structure through deacetylation of histones
(Chapter 3)—at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA; the genes coding for rRNA), telomeres (the
physical ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes; Chapter 3), and mating-type loci
(regions that differ in DNA sequence between cells of opposite mating-type) of yeast148.
The specialized chromatin structure associated with transcriptional silencing is also
repressive to recombination. Indeed, Sir2 also suppresses intrachromosomal recombina-
tion within the rRNA gene arrays, a process demonstrated by Sinclair and Guarente to
lead to an accumulation of rDNA repeats in the form of extrachromosomal circles
(ERCs)149. ERCs are self-replicating and are preferentially retained in the mother cells,
eventually causing aging by limiting yeast replicative lifespan.Increased Sir2 dose extends
yeast replicative lifespan by about 40%, whereas loss of function reduces natural
longevity150.
Other forms of increased genome instability during replicative aging of yeast, unre-
lated to rDNA loci or Sir2, have been observed. Most notably, evidence has been obtained
for so-called loss-of-heterozygosity events by studying the loss of marker loci affecting
colony color151.The steep increase of these loss-of-heterozygosity events was explained by
an increasingly impaired ability to correctly detect and repair DNA double-strand

Fig.2.4 Ames dwarf mice (df) and calorically restricted (CR) mice, both long-lived, display a lower
spontaneous mutation frequency in different tissues compared to their littermate controls (WT,
wild type). Here, only the data for the kidney are shown. The effect of dwarﬁsm is stronger than

breaks (DSBs), a major form of DNA damage in all organisms and one that can be
induced by reactive oxygen (Chapter 4). As we will see in Chapter 6, such forms of
genome instability are difﬁcult to detect in mammals. On the other hand, ERCs should
be easily detectable, but have not been observed in higher eukaryotes. However, extra-
chromosomal circular DNA is not uncommon in mammalian tissues where it also is a
sign of genomic instability152.
Apart from yeast,Sir2 orthologs have been implicated in lifespan regulation of C. elegans
and mammals. Tissenbaum and Guarente demonstrated that extra doses of Sir2.1 in
the nematode extend adult lifespan by 50%153. This extension of life appeared to be
dependent on DAF-16, linking Sir2 to the insulin-signaling pathway. Initially it was
thought that Sir2 mediated the silencing of genes in the insulin-signaling pathway in
the nematodes; that is, upstream of DAF-16. In mammals orthologs of DAF-16 are the
four FOXO proteins, a subgroup of the Forkhead family of proteins, transcriptional
regulators characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain termed the forkhead
box154 (see Chapter 3). It turned out that FOXO itself is a direct, functional target for
Sir2155. In mammalian cells, Sir2 (SIRT1 in humans) can deacetylate FOXO, increasing
its ability to induce cell-cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress, but inhibiting
FOXO’s ability to induce apoptosis156,157. Similarly, SIRT1 can deacetylate p53 and
attenuate its transcriptional activity158. Hence, Sir2 seems to speciﬁcally modulate
activities that contribute to survival. The role of FOXO in increasing cellular defense
is underscored by the observation that, in rat ﬁbroblast cells, this transcription factor
induces the repair of damaged DNA and upregulates the growth arrest and DNA damage
response gene Gadd45a159.
How can Sir2 regulate survival in different species? A possible answer can be found in
the NAD hydrolysis, an integral step of the deacetylation reaction carried out by Sir2 and
other sirtuins, which leads to the consumption of one NAD molecule for each deacety-
lated lysine residue. It has been shown that the prolongevity effect of caloric restriction—
accomplished in yeast by limiting glucose availability—is lost in the absence of Sir2160.
This suggests that calorie restriction slows aging by activating Sir2. Guarente et al.160,
then,proposed that Sir2 may connect energy metabolism to lifespan through the absolute
requirement of Sir2’s activity for NAD. If cellular NAD levels are low, then Sir2’s deacety-
lase activity could be attenuated and vice versa.As demonstrated by the Guarente labora-
tory, calorie restriction decreases the levels of NADH, a competitive inhibitor of Sir2.
Therefore, an increased NAD/NADH ratio in calorie restriction could underlie the
increased Sir2 activity, which in turn would repress recombination at the rDNA locus,
thereby slowing the formation of toxic rDNA circles and increase lifespan. This is exactly
what has been shown160. However, it is not easy to determine the effective concentrations
of NAD and NADH in living cells and the role of physiological variation in NADH in
affecting Sir2 activity is controversial161. Also, the role of Sir2 itself as a key factor in
caloric restriction has been disputed162.
THE LOGIC OF AGING
51

Interestingly, an increase in Sir2 activity by calorie restriction has been demonstrated
in mammalian cells: expression of the ortholog of Sir2, SIRT1, is induced by calorie
restriction in rats, as well as in human cells treated with serum from these animals163. It
was also shown that SIRT1 suppresses apoptosis, suggesting that the induction of SIRT1
by calorie restriction represents a survival response, similar to its deacetylation of FOXO
and p53 as described above.
Whether or not Sir2 is a master regulator, as some believe it is, there can be no doubt
that intricate mechanisms have evolved to regulate the survival of an organism as part of
its life-history strategy. As we have seen, these longevity mechanisms can be upregulated
directly or by dampening pro-aging pathways through a reduction of growth and repro-
ductive efforts.A more detailed understanding of the nature of the damage that limits our
lifespan, and the evolutionary history of its interaction with the longevity systems that
emerged to counter its effects, may give us insight into the causes of aging.
2.5 Somatic damage and the aging genome
Somatic damage accumulation appears to be a general characteristic of living organisms.
In a broad sense such damage can vary from infectious agents to DNA damage and muta-
tions. Exposure is dependent on a host of variables, including species-speciﬁc endoge-
nous and ecological factors.Nevertheless,some universal principles basic to life or at least
basic to most eukaryotes suggest similarities in exposure. For example all aerobic organ-
isms are exposed to ROS. Many organisms are exposed to body heat and such environ-
mental agents as UV and ionizing radiation. Such similarities in exposure to damaging
agents is in keeping with the universality of pathways of life extension originally uncov-
ered in nematodes and the resistance of virtually all these longevity mutants to ROS,heat,
and other damaging agents.
The most ancient example of damage accumulation in the living world is damage to
nucleic acids, ﬁrst RNA then DNA. Genetic damage posed both a fundamental problem
and an opportunity for living systems. A problem, because genetic damage essentially
prevents the perpetuation of life, since it interferes with replication (and transcription);
an opportunity, because it allows the generation of genetic variation through errors in
replicating a damaged template. Similar to the trade-offs mentioned above between
reproduction and somatic maintenance, the relative stability of a genome is optimized to
the life history of the organism. The necessity of mutations from the ﬁrst replicators
onwards is a strong argument to consider DNA damage and genetic errors as the original
instigators and major drivers of aging in the living world.
A second, logical argument to consider the DNA of the genome as the Achilles heel of
an aging organism is the irreversibility of unwanted sequence changes in view of the lack
52
THE LOGIC OF AGING

of a back-up template. This is in contrast to proteins, which at least in principle can be
easily replaced, with the corresponding gene as the template. Indeed, the maintenance of
genomic DNA is of crucial importance to survival because its alteration by mutation is
essentially irreversible and has the potential to affect all downstream processes. Third, as
explained in Chapter 5, there is now overwhelming evidence that in both humans and
mice heritable defects in genes involved in maintaining the integrity of the genome cause
symptoms of premature aging.
The ﬁrst replicating nucleic acids, almost certainly RNA, evolved almost 4 billion years
ago in an environment with little molecular oxygen, but high ﬂuxes of UV radiation due
to the absence of an ozone layer. Based on this constant threat of DNA-damaging agents
and the absolute need to increase replication ﬁdelity from the primitive RNA-replicating
systems to the much larger RNA and DNA genomes, it is now generally believed that
recombinational repair was the ﬁrst bona ﬁde DNA-repair system that evolved164,165 (see
also Chapter 4). Although mutations are essential as the ultimate source of genetic varia-
tion upon which evolution depends, too many mutations will reduce ﬁtness and can lead
to population extinction. As described above, due to Muller’s ratchet73, asexual lineages
will tend to lose mutation-free genomes (due to genetic drift) and inevitably suffer from
loss of viability. This is especially relevant for small populations and relatively easy to
demonstrate in simple unicellular organisms, such as E. coli. For example, Kibota and
Lynch demonstrated that deleterious mutations of small effect escaped selection in E. coli
lines with repeated population bottlenecks, resulting in decreased ﬁtness166. Elena and
Lensky, also in E. coli, demonstrated that randomly introduced mutations interact to
negatively affect ﬁtness; that is,the relationship between mutation number and decreased
ﬁtness was nearly log-linear167.
Is it realistic to interpret loss of ﬁtness caused by mutation accumulation in unicellular
organisms as a parallel to aging of somatic cells of metazoa? As described by Graham Bell
(see above),senescence-like phenomena have been observed in asexually propagated pro-
tozoa lineages, and were attributed to the accumulation of deleterious mutations69. Bell
explained the recombination of genetic material between different lineages—sexual out-
crossing—in terms of an exogenous repair mechanism functioning by creating variance
on which selection can act effectively to reduce mutational load.However,Bell has argued
against a parallel between mutation-induced senescence in protozoa and aging of
somatic cells in metazoa. Although he did not rule out a role for mutation accumulation
in aging of somatic cells of a mammal, he considered it unsound because senescence will
evolve—as a by-product of selection for increased early reproduction—in the soma, but
not the germ line of metazoa.In protozoa,germ cells and somatic cells are of course iden-
tical, but there is no a priori reason why Muller’s ratchet would not apply to somatic cell
lineages as well.
Mutations have been with us since the origin of life and were the primary condition
for the evolution of the wide variety of species on our planet. Indeed, organisms with
THE LOGIC OF AGING
53

sufﬁcient tolerance of their genome maintenance systems to allow for a certain level of
mutations have the best chance to survive environmental challenges. Visible examples of
this strategy are various infectious diseases in which the bacteria or viruses have the
capacity to evade drugs and the immune system by rapidly altering their antibiotic resist-
ance or cellular receptor repertoire. Indeed, pathogenic species, such as Streptococcus
pneumoniae, harbor more plastic genomes with more potential for host adaptation than
bacteria adapted to a non-threatened lifestyle, such as Streptococcus thermophilus, used
for the manufacture of yogurt and cheese168.In this particular case the difference is due to
the lack in the deadly pneumococcus of two enzymes involved in the repair of DNA DSBs
(see Chapter 4). This situation is very similar to cancer. Tumor cells often gain the capa-
bility, like pathogenic microorganisms, to rapidly alter their genotypes, thereby creating
new attributes to grow more efﬁciently, metastasize, and evade both the immune system
and various drug treatments. While in microorganisms increased genetic variation is
facilitated by stress-induced mutagenesis169, in human cancers mutator phenotypes
caused by the inactivation of genome-maintenance systems temporarily result in an
increased opportunity to adapt to adverse conditions170.
Whereas mutations in combination with recombination provide innovation at the
population level, they can cause individual failure and decreased ﬁtness. Organisms have
several ways to protect themselves against mutations or their consequences. There is ﬁrst
of all a host of genome-maintenance systems acting to prevent mutations by efﬁciently,
and most of all accurately, repairing chemical DNA damage. However, as we will see in
Chapter 4, whereas these systems are able to repair most if not all of the various types of
DNA damage continuously induced in living cells, they are imperfect. Indeed, apart from
DNA-synthesis errors per se, virtually all mutations are due to so-called error-prone
repair; that is, mistakes made during the repair of such chemical lesions. A less obvious
defense against mutations and their consequences is the fault-tolerant way genetic infor-
mation is encoded; that is, in a redundant manner with multiple copies of a gene or with
different genes or pathways that can carry out similar functions. A third way to limit the
impact of mutations is by avoiding extreme optimization of function, which implies
tolerance for defects. Finally, organisms use so-called genetic capacitance, which involves
proteins that buffer the effects of mutations,such as the heat-shock proteins or molecular
chaperones that were demonstrated to increase nematode lifespan (see above).
Overall,therefore,organisms are robust: they are able to maintain function against var-
ious perturbations. Nevertheless, even robustness that is ubiquitous in biological systems
has inherent trade-offs and failure patterns. These become especially apparent in multi-
cellular organisms. While unicellular organisms can out-select mutation accumulation,
in multicellular organisms this is only true for the germ line. Indeed, in animals
germ-line cells are set aside very early in life, after which there is ample opportunity for
selection against gametes and gamete combinations carrying deleterious mutations.
(Plants do not set aside a germ-line early on in life, but instead rely on stringent selection
54
THE LOGIC OF AGING

during the haploid gametophytic phase and selection during somatic growth when cell
lineages carrying deleterious mutations are impaired in growth and development and
therefore less likely to contribute to gamete formation171.) Even then, signs of system
failure are evident even very early in life. In humans, for example, this translates in the
relatively high percentage of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths, which are most
likely caused by mutations172 (see Chapter 6). It is estimated that every human new-
born has acquired as many as 100 new mutations per genome, three of which might be
deleterious173.
In the somatic genome of multicellular organisms selection against deleterious muta-
tions is more difﬁcult than in the germ line.Obviously,cell loss or cellular loss of function
due to deleterious mutations will contribute to functional decline of the organ and may
cause disease, most notably cancer. In theory, optimization of genome-maintenance
mechanisms for only the somatic cells could prevent any signiﬁcant mutation accumula-
tion. However, evolutionary theory would not predict a maximization of cellular mainte-
nance and repair in view of the gradual decline of the force of natural selection after the
age of ﬁrst reproduction (see above). In most cases, our fault-tolerant genomes would
allow mutation accumulation well into the reproductive period without appreciable loss
of function. However, it is unlikely that even slight increases in mutation loads thereafter
would have no consequences.
An observation that has often been used to discard the idea that mutation accumula-
tion could adversely affect physiological functioning and cause aging and death is the
identical lifespans of haploid and diploid wasps of the genus Habrobracon174. As in other
hymenopterans, in Habrobracon unfertilized eggs become haploid males and fertilized
eggs that are homozygous and heterozygous at the sex locus develop into diploid males
and females, respectively.While X-irradiation of larvae, pupae, or adults reduced lifespan
of the haploid variant more than that of its diploid counterpart, their normal aging rate
was the same. Somewhat surprisingly, the results of this isolated observation, which has
not been conﬁrmed in other species for which both haploid and diploid variants exist,has
been widely interpreted to discard the somatic mutation theory of aging.
As argued by Alec Morley (Adelaide, Australia) in a lucid paper not cited frequently
enough, the Habrobracon results, even if reproducibly obtained in multiple species, do
not exclude a causal role in aging of dominant or co-dominant mutations, which may be
more important in terms of functional signiﬁcance upon their random induction in
somatic cells175 (see also Chapter 6). Most importantly, although the authors assumed
that mutations were the cause of the reduced lifespan in the wasps after X-irradiation,this
is unlikely to be true. Indeed, adverse effects after an acute dose of X-rays are more likely
to be caused by the toxic effects of DNA damage rather than mutations. As we shall see
in Chapters 4 and 6, mutations are the result, mainly, of erroneous processing of DNA
damage; their introduction requires time. Acute effects of DNA damage are likely to be
mitigated by an additional copy of each gene as in the diploid situation. The absence of a
THE LOGIC OF AGING
55

difference in lifespan between the unirradiated haploid and diploid animals is not incon-
sistent with a causal role of dominant mutations in aging. Indeed, as will be argued later
(Chapter 7), mutations in the form of large rearrangements could easily lead to genome
destabilization and an aberrant pattern of gene expression. This would be the case for
both haploid and diploid genomes. An in-depth investigation of the haploid versus
diploid aging wasps would be necessary to test this hypothesis.
In summary, from the earliest replicators onwards the logic of life with its need for
evolvability has dictated the logic of aging. Species-speciﬁc lifespans reﬂect the balance
between growth and reproduction and somatic maintenance and repair (Fig. 2.5).
Somatic maintenance and repair initially only involved the need to preserve the genome,
but later also other cellular and organismal structures became important. It is possible
that even with the emergence of billions of different species of increasing complexity this
basic principle is still valid and the genome may still be the most relevant target of the
aging process. What has changed, however, is the complexity of genome structure and
function, and with it the diversity of threats to its integrity. This will be discussed in the
next chapter.

Genome structure and 
function
As described in Chapter 1, the science of aging has evolved in concert with an emerging
insight into both the logic of life and its structure–function relationships. Insight into the
logic of life gave us insight into the logic of aging, as outlined in Chapter 2. However,
whereas we know why we age, the mechanistic basis of the process as it takes place in dif-
ferent species is still unclear.Full knowledge of how we age can only emerge hand in hand
with the further uncovering of the basic principles underlying the nature of the living
world. In the life sciences it is now slowly being realized that the unraveling of how life is
ordered cannot be separated from enquiries into what causes its progressive disorder and
ultimate demise. Genome structure and function are central to the organization of life.
They determine our species-speciﬁc characteristics and provide the conditions for indi-
vidual development and maturation. As such, the genome may bear the roots of its own
destruction and with it the causes of age-related cellular degeneration and death.
The genome, a term coined in 1920 by Hans Winkler, a Professor of Botany at the
University of Hamburg,to designate the haploid chromosome set,has more recently been
considered to mean the whole complement of genes of an organism and sometimes also
the sum total of coding and non-coding DNA sequences (see also Chapter 1). Here I will
deﬁne a genome in somewhat broader terms as the organelle or physical entity that car-
ries out all genetic transactions in a cell or organism.This necessitates a three-dimensional
view of the genome as a coordinated ensemble of gene action in the context of a series of
structure–function relationships, which ultimately represents the complete network of
processes that deﬁnes a living organism. Such a genome interacts extensively with other
molecules.
To understand how the genome exerts its function as the ultimate determinant of both
order and progressive disorder it is necessary to know its structure and functional organi-
zation. There are recent textbooks and extensive review articles to which I refer for
comprehensive information on various aspects of genome structure and function176,177.
Here, I will focus predominantly on those components of genome structure that have
the potential to drive its demise in somatic cells over time, based on our current knowl-
edge of the sources of somatic damage in aging organisms and mechanisms of genomic
instability. To this end, I will address genome structure and organization at three levels:
ﬁrst, DNA primary structure and sequence; second, higher-order DNA structure; and
third, nuclear architecture. In all cases the focus will be on the impact of these structural

levels on cellular function, especially patterns of regulation of gene transcription, which
will be discussed in the last section of this chapter.
3.1 DNA primary structure
As discussed in Chapter 1,the landmark discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA
by Watson and Crick in 1953 provided a logical basis for the role of the genome in both
the perpetuation of life in evolutionary time and its functional organization (see Fig.1.4).
The DNA of the genome is a polymer consisting of four different types of monomer
units, termed nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a ﬁve-carbon sugar (deoxyribose),
a nitrogen-containing base attached to the sugar, and a phosphate group. The differences
between the four nucleotides are determined by the different bases: adenine (A), guanine
(G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Adenine and guanine are the purine bases and the
larger of the two types, with cytosine and thymine the relatively small pyrimidine bases.
RNA is different from DNA,since its nucleotides contain a ribose instead of a deoxyribose
as the sugar, and uracil (U) replaces the thymine base. Apart from their major—amino
and keto—tautomeric forms, the DNA bases can adopt alternate forms; the imino form
for adenine and cytosine and the enol form for guanine and thymine. Although these
structural isomers are rare, they do alter base-pairing properties, which makes them
a source of mutations when accidentally present during DNA replicative or repair
synthesis.
The monomer units in nucleic acids are connected through the phosphate residue
attached to the hydroxyl group on the 5' carbon of one unit and the 3' hydroxyl on the
next one (Fig. 3.1). This forms a phosphodiester link between two residues (shown as p;
e.g. CpG), which can lead to very long nucleic acids—up to billions of units. The het-
eropolymeric character of nucleic acids is the basis for their role in information storage
and transmission in the form of a base sequence code of nucleotides. As discovered by
Watson and Crick12, the DNA of the genome is a double-stranded macromolecule, with a
double-helical structure of two polynucleotide chains,held together by speciﬁc pairing of
AT and GC base pairs stacked on one another with their planes nearly perpendicular to
the helix axis (Fig. 3.2). This conﬁguration allows strong van-der-Waals interactions
between the bases.
DNA has both a sense of direction and individuality. The phosphodiester linkage
between monomer units is always between the 5' carbon of one monomer and the 3'
carbon of the next. The two strands in the double-helical model run in opposite direc-
tions (Fig. 3.2). Individuality is, of course, determined by the sequence of its bases; that
is, the nucleotide sequence. It is in the primary structure of a nucleic acid that genetic
58
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

information is stored as a four-letter code, encoding genes and gene-regulatory or struc-
tural sequences.
Polynucleotides are thermodynamically unstable in vivo but their hydrolysis is exceed-
ingly slow unless catalyzed. Similarly, whereas dehydration would readily allow adding
nucleotide residues to a nucleic acid chain, the thermodynamics of this reaction are unfa-
vorable and require high-energy nucleoside triphosphates (ATPs). Hence, both the break-
down and synthesis of nucleic acids require enzymatic processes; in their absence DNA is
sufﬁciently stable to serve as a useful repository of genetic information.Nevertheless,DNA
is not completely stable under physiological conditions.Apart from errors during its repli-
cation, DNA can be damaged through its interaction with a variety of reactive chemicals

or radiation. Even in the absence of environmental challenges, the DNA in each cell of an
organism suffers from a multitude of endogenous damage, resulting from spontaneous
hydrolysis and oxidation (in aerobic organisms). Spontaneous DNA damage, DNA repair,
and genome instability are discussed extensively in Chapters 4 and 6.
Nucleic acids can have several secondary structures, including the right-handed A and
B helices, which differ mainly in the position of the bases with respect to the helix axis,
and the left-handed Z helix, discovered by Alexander Rich (Cambridge, MA, USA) and
co-workers in 1979178. Probably, most of the DNA in the aqueous milieu of cells in vivo is
in the B form, whereas the A conformation is adopted by double-stranded RNA and
DNA–RNA hybrids. The surface of the B helix contains two different grooves, called the
major and minor groove (Fig. 3.2). Proteins that interact with DNA often make contact
in these grooves, especially the major groove, which is larger and more suitable for
sequence-speciﬁc recognition. Unfortunately, since these areas contain an abundance
of reactive sites they are also often the target of DNA-damaging agents (see Chapter 6).
Z-DNA occurs in regions of polynucleotides having alternating purine–pyrimidine
sequences with a substantial fraction of the C residues methylated to form 5-methylcytosine.

This modiﬁcation of C occurs to a signiﬁcant extent in natural DNA, where it plays a role
in such transactions as the regulation of gene transcription (see below).
Apart from double-helical DNA, the genome in vivo may also contain multistranded
DNA structures such as triplexes, quadruplexes, and junctions (Fig. 3.3). Some of these,
for example Holliday junctions, can be intermediates of DNA transactions, such as
homologous recombination (Chapter 4). A large variety of others may form sponta-
neously in an aqueous milieu and could have important biological implications.
Examples of genomic DNA sequences with the potential to form such structures are
the telomeric regions at the end of chromosomes and the so-called promoter regions
that regulate gene action (see below). Most of these sequences have continuous stretches
of guanine nucleotides, and the ability of the guanine base to form tetrads (DNA
tetraplexes or G quadruplexes), with four guanines in a plane, lies at the crux of these
complex structures. Among these, the structures formed by the telomere sequences have
been the most widely investigated in relation to aging, especially in relation to the gene
defects causing Werner syndrome, a segmental progeroid syndrome due to the inactiva-
tion of the WRN gene,a RecQ helicase thought to be involved in resolving such structures
(Chapters 4 and 6).
3.1.1 GENES IN GENOMES
As we have seen in Chapter 1, the genes, hidden in the primary structure of the DNA of
the genome, give rise to phenotypes through the generation of corresponding protein
products by transcription and translation. However, the relationship between genes as
the units of inheritance and their physical structure has become somewhat nebulous in
view of the recognized need for accessory DNA sequences to regulate transcription.
Indeed, genomes are complex and represent more than a bag of genes. This is illustrated
by the results of the comparative analysis of the hundreds of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
genomes that have now been decoded, including the complete sequences of ﬁve

mammals: human, mouse, rat, dog, and cow. Genomes can vary in size from about 
0.5 million bp (0.5 megabases or Mb) in Nanoarchaeum equitans, the smallest genome of
a true organism yet found, with slightly more than 500 genes, to 3000 Mb in the human
genome, with about 30 000 genes (see www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ for all genome-
related databases). In general, such comparative analysis has revealed increases in
complexity from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes.
Whereas genome size appears to be generally associated with organismal complexity
this is much less obvious for the number of genes. For example, whereas humans have
only about 10 000 more genes than C. elegans, the human genome is 30-fold larger than
that of the nematode (see Table 3.1 for a comparison of genome features among selected
species). Virtually all of the increase in genome size from prokaryotes to mammals is
caused by the addition of non-genic DNA.Whereas E. coli has about 4000 protein-coding
genes comprising almost 90% of its total sequence, in the human (or mouse) genome
only slightly more than 1% is protein-coding sequence. Whereas there is an ongoing
debate about the possible function of much of this non-genic DNA, one explanation that
has been put forward for the origin of genome complexity in vertebrates is the enormous
reduction in population size associated with the emergence of higher eukaryotes of larger
size. This would permit an initially non-adaptive restructuring of eukaryotic genomes by
genetic drift, providing novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic com-
plexity179. However, it should be realized that genome size varies enormously among
organisms without any obvious relationship to complexity.For example,Amoeba dubia,a
small protozoan species of indisputably lower complexity than Homo sapiens, has a
genome size of 670 billion bp, more than 100-fold the size of the human genome. Before
drawing the conclusion that these ﬁgures demonstrate that large genomes and complex-
ity are not associated it should be realized that these extraordinary large genome sizes
are not based on complete sequence information but on biochemical measurements.
In such cases genome size may be greatly exaggerated since they do not account for

mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),the amount of which can be substantial,and a sometimes
high levels of polyploidy (see the Animal Genome Size Database,www.genomesize.com).
Non-genic DNA in the mammalian genome includes the relatively small 5' and 3'
untranslated regions ﬂanking the genes,spliceosomal introns,dispersed within genes and
comprising as much as 95% of the genes, mobile and repetitive genetic elements, tandem
repeats at centromeres and telomeres, and non-coding RNA genes (Fig. 3.4). Whereas in
the past much of this type of DNA has been considered as junk DNA (because there
seemed to be no obvious beneﬁt to the host) or selﬁsh DNA (because its only function
seems to be to make more copies of itself), it is now clear that at least a sizable part of it
must be functional180. This is suggested by the evolutionary conservation of many non-
genic DNA sequences.
As explained in Chapter 1 once complete genome sequences were available it became
possible to compare them in their entirety (e.g. human and mouse) for sequences of high
similarity as a result of negative selection. Inter-species studies of homology revealed that
a large part of the human or mouse genome—as much as about 20%—is subject to evo-
lutionary constraint180. It should be noted that the situation for families of repeat ele-
ments (discussed below) has its own peculiarities. Indeed, such families, which are
abundantly present in mammalian genomes, can be highly divergent between species.
However, there is a high level of sequence conservation between repeats, which can
include genes such as rRNA genes,within a species.This is called concerted evolution and
based on what has been termed genetic drive181. At least some repeat families, certainly
the satellites found at centromeres (see below) have a highly conserved biological func-
tion (in spite of their high divergence between species).

apart from mobile genetic elements and genes, are the various families of tandem repeats, non-
coding RNAs, pseudogenes, and some as yet still unidentiﬁed DNA.

Interestingly, whereas high levels of conservation were found (as expected) in protein-
coding parts of genes, 1–2% of the human genome represents equally highly conserved,
non-genic sequences.The distribution of such sequences is negatively correlated with the
distribution of genes182. This suggests that their function either involves long-distance
regulation of gene expression or some other important role, such as in chromosomal
transactions or in the interaction of the genome with other cellular and nuclear struc-
tures (see below).
Another characteristic feature of complex genomes,such as the human genome,is that
while only about 1% may encode proteins, a much larger part (perhaps almost 50%180) is
transcribed.It is possible that at least a part of these non-coding RNA molecules function
in the regulation of gene transcription. For one category of non-coding RNAs (see
below), the so-called miRNAs, this has now been demonstrated. What this picture of the
genome suggests is that the structural and physiological complexity of organisms is
dependent not so much on their genes, but on the way the activity of these genes is regu-
lated. This can be very different from species to species even if most of their protein
sequences and core regulatory regions are virtually identical. Indeed, the regulation of
gene expression takes place at many levels, of which the relative position of genes and
regulatory regions is of critical importance. As noticed by the late Alan Wilson
(1934–1991), among placental mammals the variation in karyotype (chromosome num-
ber, large inversions or deletions) is much more dramatic than in the primary DNA
sequence183. Indeed, based on early cytogenetic comparisons one would never believe
that the mammalian genome is so highly conserved at the sequence level. During evolu-
tion of the different mammalian lineages, many genome rearrangements have scrambled
the relative positions of genes and other homologous sequences beyond recognition. As
noticed by several authors, including those active in the science of aging184, it is unlikely
that the considerable differences between human and chimpanzee, not least the approxi-
mately 2-fold difference in maximum lifespan, are due to differences in their protein
sequences. Instead, there is ample reason to believe that much of the phenotypic differ-
ence between closely related species is explained by evolutionary changes in gene regula-
tion. Apparently, a large number of genome rearrangements can occur over a relatively
short evolutionary time span.
3.1.2 GENE DISPERSION AND MODULAR ORGANIZATION
In the mammalian genome, genes are clustered densely into small islands in desert-like
expanses containing few or no genes. While their protein-coding sequences occupy only
about 1% of the entire DNA sequence, their interruption by introns allows them to be
spread over huge distances.Introns,which comprise about 24% of the genomic sequence,
are non-coding stretches of DNA that are transcribed, but eventually excised from the
64
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

primary transcript, thereby fusing the remaining parts, termed exons into the ﬁnal,
protein-coding mRNA. Introns almost never appear in prokaryotic cells and are rare in
single-celled eukaryotes, but in multicellular animals and plants almost every gene has
introns. Both terms—intron and exon—were coined by Walter Gilbert (Cambridge, MA,
USA) in 1978, who postulated that exons were originally minigenes corresponding to
current protein domains (structurally and functionally deﬁned, semi-independent parts
of a protein)185.At a later stage in evolution,the minigenes were assembled to make whole
genes, with introns as the functionless pieces that held the exons together. Bacteria may
have lost introns in later evolutionary stages. Now we know that exons do not always map
to those domains. Indeed, another school of thought argues that introns are a relatively
recent arrival in the eukaryotic lineage and necessary to help generate the diversity of
regulatory mechanisms that are required to control gene expression in multicellular,
highly differentiated organisms186. In this view, prokaryotes do not have introns because
they never had them in the ﬁrst place.
At ﬁrst sight introns seem to impose a selective disadvantage on their host genes by
increasing the chance of mutation to yield defective alleles. On the other hand, introns
provide for alternative splicing (making different combinations of exons), which is
advantageous to eukaryotes because it allows single genes to encode multiple protein iso-
forms, a major source of genetic diversity. Introns may also have other functions, includ-
ing a role in nucleosome formation and in anchoring chromatin loops to the nuclear
matrix and to chromosome scaffolds (see below). The modular nature of genes in higher
eukaryotes with so many introns has led to the substitution of the term transcription unit
for the original gene or cistron, which remains valid in prokaryotes. The concept of a
gene in mammalian genomes is blurred, not only by alternative splicing, which creates
different proteins from one gene, but also by the discovery that different genes can physi-
cally overlap and that sometimes an exonic sequence in one gene is part of an intron in
another.
3.1.3 MOBILE GENETIC ELEMENTS AND DISPERSED REPEATS
Originally discovered by Barbara McClintock (1902–1992) in maize187, mobile genetic
elements, such as Alu and L1 sequences, make up about 45% of the human genome.
Mobile genetic elements are pieces of DNA that can move from one place in the genome
to another.By insertion into a gene,they can be the cause of the mutations responsible for
some cases of human genetic diseases, including hemophilia188. Like for introns there has
been a debate as to whether such sequences have a function or should be merely consid-
ered as junk DNA. There is ample evidence that mobile genetic elements can contribute
to genome evolution by providing regulatory elements to neighboring genes or by help-
ing to create new combinations of exons, promoters, and enhancers189. It is also possible
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
65

that these repeat elements have some structural role and help providing the necessary
physical organization required for effective, integrated genome functioning.
There are four main families of mobile genetic elements in the human genome. First,
the long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), of more than 6 kb; second, small inter-
spersed nuclear elements (SINEs), of less than 500 bp, such as Alu; third, the retrovirus-
like transposons; and fourth the DNA transposons. The ﬁrst three proliferate via an RNA
intermediate; only DNA transposons are real jumping genes, moving from one place to
another by using a cut-and-paste mechanism. Here I will only brieﬂy discuss the LINE1
element, also termed L1.
The L1 retrotransposon is the most abundant dispersed repeat sequence, comprising
over one-third of the entire human genome190. This sequence generates a copy of itself,
through transcription followed by reverse transcription,which then integrates elsewhere.
About 100 L1 elements in the human genome are still active to retrotranspose and are
therefore an ongoing source of mutations. Because L1 elements are so widespread and
present in so many copies, they are also a target for erroneous homologous recombina-
tion (see Chapter 4 for a detailed description). In view of these adverse effects, one might
wonder why L1 repeats,in spite of their evolutionary beneﬁts,are tolerated in the genome
and have not disappeared.
Apart from the fact that the efﬁcacy of natural selection would be insufﬁcient to pre-
vent the spread of this evolutionary useful sequence—provided the activity of this aggres-
sive mutator is dampened sufﬁciently long to allow its host to reach the reproductive
age—L1 repeats are likely to have some beneﬁts. L1 repeats may serve as attenuators of
gene-transcriptional activity by spreading heterochromatin formation through cytosine
methylation of its promoter191 (see also below). Another suggested function of L1 ele-
ments involved their capacity to cause mutations. It has recently been demonstrated that
an engineered human L1 element can retrotranspose in neuronal precursors derived
from rat hippocampus neural stem cells192.The resulting retrotransposition events some-
times altered the expression of neuronal genes, affecting neuronal differentiation. The
same investigators also showed that the L1 element was active in transgenic mice, result-
ing in neuronal somatic mosaicism. They suggested that L1 repeats could contribute in
this way to neuronal somatic diversiﬁcation in the developing brain, possibly explaining
individual differences in brain organization and function. Whether or not this will prove
to be correct (see also Chapter 6), these observations underscore the fact that somatic
genomes are not static, but diverge during development, and possibly also during aging,
because of de novo DNA sequence changes.
Totally different types of dispersed repeat are the simple sequence repeat families
termed microsatellites and minisatellites. These elements, with a unit size of between
about 2 and 20 nucleotides,are organized as loci of tandem repeats dispersed through the
genome. They tend to be unstable, with some loci showing dramatically high mutation
frequencies, often based on so-called slippage replication errors, leading to copy-number
66
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

variation (Fig. 3.5). It explains why these loci are so polymorphic in the germ line, which
makes them highly suitable for DNA-based identity testing (DNA ﬁngerprinting) and as
markers in genetic linkage studies aimed at discovering the location of disease genes193.
Mini- and microsatellites are unstable in both the germ line (parent-to-offspring) and
somatic cells. For microsatellite loci (including tracts of the same base) this may be due
mostly to slippage replication errors, whereas minisatellite variation appears to involve
mainly unequal exchange during recombination. Indeed, microsatellite instability is
especially prominent in the presence of a defect in DNA-mismatch repair, the system that
edits the newly synthesized DNA strand to correct mismatches, including those that
result from slippage replication errors.Tumors arising in patients with a heritable form of
cancer caused by a defect in DNA-mismatch repair often display this form of microsatel-
lite instability since they are unable to repair the mismatches that are a consequence of
slippage replication errors (see Chapter 4).
Microsatellite instability has also been associated with an intriguing set of heritable
diseases, including Huntington’s disease, fragile X syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy.
These diseases are caused by an increase in the number of copies of the repeat beyond its
normal range of about 6–55 repeats. This so-called genetic anticipation (Fig. 3.5), which
occurs in the germ line, is responsible for the increasing severity of an inherited disease
during intergenerational transmission. Studies of these diseases and the repeats involved
have shown that this type of genomic instability is highly dynamic194. Disease-related
instability of the repeats is not limited to the germ line but occurs also in somatic cells in a
tissue-dependent manner. We have already seen that in C. elegans both DAF-16 and the
regulator of the heat-shock response, HSF-1, protect against the adverse consequences of

form of genome instability will be discussed in Chapter 6.
3.1.4 TANDEM REPEATS AND CHROMOSOME STRUCTURE
Apart from the dispersed loci of short tandem repeats,most eukaryotes have many copies
of tandemly repeated DNA sequences located around their centromeres and at the telom-
eres. Centromeres (the points at which spindle microtubules attach; see below) are
responsible for chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis and contain mainly
so-called -satellite repeats. These highly homogeneous repeats, which are not tran-
scribed,have a basic 170-bp unit and are required for centromere function in a way that is
still unclear195. As mentioned above, these sequences are subject to concerted evolution,
meaning that they show a high level of sequence conservation within a species but are
divergent between species. However, while their sequences are divergent, the function
of centromeres is conserved throughout eukaryotic biology and possibly based on a
universal chromatin structure196.
Telomeres are the nucleoprotein complexes that occur at the ends of eukaryotic linear
chromosomes. In the mammalian genome they consist of several kilobase pairs of repeti-
tive DNA sequences (TTAGGG) that attract a number of sequence- and structure-
speciﬁc binding proteins. These chromosomal caps prevent nucleolytic degradation and
provide a mechanism for cells to distinguish natural termini from DNA DSBs, which
signal DNA damage and would result in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis197. The
protective properties of telomeres were recognized by Barbara McClintock and Herman
Muller, the latter of whom coined the term telomere. Telomeres terminate in 35–600
bases of single-stranded TTAGGG at the 3' end (the 3' overhang). This 3' overhang folds
back into the duplex TTAGGG repeat array, forming a so-called T loop198 (see also
Fig. 4.7a). Telomeres are also thought to buffer the internal coding regions of the genome
from the consequences of the end replication problem; that is, the inability to complete
the 5' end by lagging-strand synthesis (Fig. 4.7b). While this may temporarily protect the
genome against attrition, cells would inevitably lose terminal DNA with each cell divi-
sion. However, telomere attrition can be countered by elongation mechanisms (see also
Chapters 4 and 6).
3.1.5 NON-CODING RNA GENES
Non-coding RNA genes produce transcripts that function directly in regulatory,catalytic,
or structural roles in the cell.They represent a major component of the transcriptomes of
68
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

higher organisms and can be subdivided into housekeeping RNAs and regulatory
RNAs199. Housekeeping RNAs include rRNAs, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and small
nucleolar RNAs, implicated in such functions as splice regulation and rRNA modiﬁca-
tion.Also the template RNA component of telomerase (TERC) should be considered as a
housekeeping non-coding RNA. Regulatory non-coding RNAs include miRNAs, which
can induce posttranscriptional gene-silencing activity, either by translational repression
or by triggering mRNA degradation (Chapter 1).
In addition to the small non-coding RNAs, there are also larger regulatory non-coding
RNAs. The best known example is the X-inactive speciﬁc transcript (Xist) gene. The
15–17-kb-long (in mice) Xist non-coding RNAs play a key role in transcriptional silenc-
ing of the X chromosome during early female embryogenesis, as part of the dosage com-
pensation of X-linked gene products in mammals200. At the time of X-chromosome
inactivation, Xist RNA becomes stable and accumulates. It spreads and eventually coats
the whole chromosome.Whereas it is not exactly clear how this spreading takes place and
how it brings about transcriptional silencing, evidence has been obtained that L1
elements, which are enriched on the X chromosome, serve to promote spreading. As
mentioned above, methylation of the L1 repeats may play a role in stabilizing the inactive
state, which originally may have been a silencing mechanism to defend the genome
against parasites191. Modiﬁcation of histone proteins may play a role as well (see below
for a discussion of the role of methylation and histone modiﬁcation in gene silencing).
3.1.6 MITOCHONDRIAL GENOMES
In a discussion of genome primary structure focused on mammals and other eukaryotes,
it is important to mention the existence of a separate genome: the mitochondrial genome.
Neither eubacteria nor archaea contain organelles, such as mitochondria, lysosomes, and
endoplasmatic reticulum, which abound in eukaryotes. According to the endosymbiosis
theory, the mitochondria of eukaryotes evolved from aerobic bacteria (probably related
to the rickettsias) living within their host cell201. Mitochondria can arise only from pre-
existing mitochondria and cannot be formed in a cell that lacks them because the nuclear
genome encodes most but not all of the mitochondrial proteins. The remainder is
encoded in the mitochondrion’s own genome, which resembles that of prokaryotes, not
that of the nuclear genome. The genome of human mitochondria contains 16 569 bp of
DNA organized in a closed circle (Fig. 3.6). This encodes two rRNA molecules, 22 tRNA
molecules and 13 polypeptides, which participate in building several protein complexes
embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane: seven subunits that make up the mito-
chondrial NADH dehydrogenase, three subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, two subunits
of ATP synthase, and cytochrome b. Vertebrate transcription is initiated at two promot-
ers, PH and PL for heavy and light strands respectively, located 150 nucleotides apart
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
69

within the D-loop regulatory region. The H- and L-strand transcriptional units specify
multiple genes, as in prokaryotes. However, like in eukaryotes, the mRNAs have poly(A)
tails. The proteins encoded by nuclear genes (e.g. cytochrome c and the RNA and DNA
polymerases used within the mitochondrion) are synthesized in the cytosol and then
imported into the mitochondrion.
3.1.7 SUMMARY
In summary, the primary chemistry of the DNA of the genome dictates a highly stable
structure harboring an abundance of functional elements of which protein-coding
sequences are only a very small fraction. Most of the functional elements in a genome are
probably involved in transcription regulation or in facilitating chromosome structure.
How do such sequence elements exert their function? It is now clear that many of the
functional DNA elements in the genome function through alterations in DNA higher-
order structure, often through interactions with proteins. This is obvious for those
sequences determining speciﬁc chromosomal structures relevant for processes such as

cell division. However, the packaging of the DNA in the cell also controls accessibility of
the sequences essential for basal or regulated gene expression. In Chapter 4 it will become
clear that alterations in DNA packaging are important, not only for transcription regula-
tion and basic structural maintenance, but also for the continuous repair of chemical
damage inﬂicted upon the DNA from a multitude of endogenous and environmental
sources. While attention thus far has been focused on alterations in DNA primary struc-
ture and sequence, changes in DNA higher-order structure, also termed epigenomic
changes, are gaining increasing interest as possible causal factors in aging and disease (see
also Chapter 6). Below, I will brieﬂy discuss DNA higher-order structure and the mecha-
nisms that facilitate genome reprogramming (or epigenetic control) during develop-
ment, in tissue-speciﬁc gene expression, and in global gene silencing.
3.2 Higher-order DNA structure
One level up in the structural regulation of genome function from the DNA double helix
and its primary sequence code is the folding of its DNA into chromatin. Chromatin is
more than the genome and denotes the complex of DNA and proteins that form the chro-
mosomes. As we shall see, by organizing itself as chromatin the genome maximizes its
information content and simultaneously creates ways to make this information available
whenever and wherever this is needed.
Most prokaryotic genomes are contained in a single, circular DNA molecule, tightly
coiled in a compact structure called the nucleoid, with much less associated protein than
eukaryotic chromosomes. The genome of eukaryotes is organized in the form of linear
chromosomes, composed of euchromatin and heterochromatin, residing in a nucleus
separate from the cytoplasm. Heterochromatin is compact, generally inaccessible to
DNA-binding factors and transcriptionally silent. Euchromatic domains are the more
accessible and transcriptionally active portions of the genome. What is the underlying
structure that deﬁnes chromatin at the functional level? The basic unit of chromatin is
the nucleosome. Nucleosomes consist of approximately 200 bp of DNA wrapped
around an octamer of core histone proteins, consisting of two copies each of histones
H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This structure is the beads-on-a-string-conformation and can
be condensed into the tightly packaged solenoid structure or 30-nm ﬁber.The molecular
arrangement of the higher levels of chromatin organization is not well understood, but
light- and electron-microscopic studies of interphase and metaphase chromosomes
have revealed ﬁbers ranging from 100 nm to the 700 nm structure seen in the metaphase
chromosomes during cell division202,203. Figure 3.7 schematically depicts what is proba-
bly the current consensus with respect to the organization of the DNA in a mammalian
cell nucleus.
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
71

Active or potentially active genes exist in the simple nucleosomal structure (euchro-
matin). In the regulatory regions of active genes nucleosomes are either removed or
undergo structural alteration, which facilitates the binding of transcription factors (see
below). These segments are sensitive to chemical and enzymatic attack because they are
protected by histone proteins only poorly, if at all. They are called hypersensitive sites to
indicate their extreme sensitivity to enzymatic digestion and typically appear and disap-
pear in patterns that are coordinated with gene activity; that is, more hypersensitive sites
appear as gene activity increases.
The highly compacted chromatin ﬁbers represent heterochromatin domains, where
genes are not transcriptionally active. Some heterochromatin is condensed chromatin
that unfolds and becomes transcriptionally active during some portion of the cell cycle.
Constitutive heterochromatin remains transcriptionally inert during the entire cell cycle.
The bulk of constitutive heterochromatin is composed of repetitive DNA, such as at

the centromeres and telomeres. Because DNA replication requires polymerases and
regulatory proteins similar to those required for DNA transcription, condensed hete-
rochromatin most likely unfolds into euchromatin before replication proceeds.
Using powerful new methods the genomic distribution of nucleosomes is now being
determined. In the ChIP-on-chip method204, protein–DNA complexes are cross-linked
by the addition of formaldehyde to living cells. After lysis of the cells and mechanical
shearing of the chromatin to yield fragments of 0.5–2 kb, the cross-linked protein–DNA
complexes are immunoprecipitated using antibodies against invariant portions of his-
tones. The DNA, recovered from the immunoprecipitated complexes, is then used as a
probe to hybridize a DNA microarray harboring thousands of sequences covering the
genome. The microarray signals indicate nucleosome density at that particular sequence.
Application of such genome-wide methods is easiest in organisms with a small genome,
such as yeast. Indeed, for this organism it could be concluded that upstream regions of
highly active genes in yeast display a reduced nucleosome density compared to the
upstream regions of inactive genes205. Hence, gene activation in yeast is associated with
reduced nucleosome density. How is the situation in the genome of higher eukaryotes,
which is so much more complex?
As mentioned above, human genes are not uniformly spread across the genome, but
tend to be clustered together. To determine the chromatin architecture of the human
genome, Gilbert et al. separated compact- and open-chromatin-ﬁber structures from a
human lymphoblastoid cell line by sucrose sedimentation and analyzed their distribu-
tions by hybridization to metaphase chromosomes and genomic microarrays206. Their
results indicate that gene-rich areas in the human genome are preferentially located in
open chromatin ﬁbers; that is, structures mostly devoid of ﬁbers beyond 30 nm.
However, this ﬁrst study to globally map higher-order DNA structure in the human
genome also revealed that there is no strict correlation between open chromatin and the
activity of a gene. Indeed, not every gene in the open areas is being transcribed and active
genes in regions of low gene density can be embedded in compact chromatin ﬁbers. As
will be outlined later, various protein factors are able to regulate transcriptional activity
through chromatin remodeling at the level of an individual gene.
Various factors are involved in maintaining and altering higher-order DNA structure,
which is exquisitely regulated and provides an additional layer of information to the
primary sequence code of the DNA. This type of regulation involves epigenetic alter-
ations, heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA
sequence207. The best-known example is genomic imprinting, which is a type of genomic
modiﬁcation that in mammals dictates the inactivation of either the paternal or maternal
copies of a gene. Methylation is the epigenetic marker most likely responsible for repress-
ing the activity of one of the alleles. Methylation of C residues at carbon 5 of the pyrimi-
dine ring, primarily at CpG sequences, is widespread in mammalian genomic DNA and
essentially an extension of the genetic code to a ﬁfth base. Imprinted genes often contain
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
73

parent-speciﬁc differences in DNA methylation within genomic regions known as
differentially methylated domains (DMDs). Patterns of CpG methylation are maintained
by the action of Dnmt1, the mammalian maintenance cytosine methyltransferase
enzyme. Apart from imprinted genes, other regions of the genome with high levels of
methylated CpG dinucleotides are the inactive X chromosome in female mammals and
mobile genetic elements, all of which are associated with stable transcriptional repres-
sion. Gene silencing often occurs through hypermethylation of CpG-rich, promoter-
associated regions, termed CpG islands (see below).
Yet another genome project, the Human Epigenome Project (HEP), aims to identify,
catalogue and interpret genome-wide DNA methylation patterns of all human genes in
all major tissues. The data, obtained by high-throughput methods, are deposited in a
public database (www.epigenome.org). Since methylation patterns are known to
undergo alterations during aging,such a systematic whole-genome study of DNA methy-
lation at the sequence level could be a prelude to the systematic evaluation of aging-
related patterns of DNA methylation levels of sites within the vicinity of the promoter
and other relevant regions of a gene (see also Chapter 6).
Other factors that determine epigenetic regulation of gene expression involve histone
proteins. DNA is bound to the histones through electrostatic forces between the nega-
tively charged phosphate groups in the DNA backbone and positively charged amino
acids (e.g. lysine and arginine) in the histone proteins. Histone proteins can be modiﬁed
by the addition of acetyl, methyl, or phosphate groups, and this alters the strength of the
bonding between the histones and DNA. Modiﬁcations such as these are usually associ-
ated with the regulation of DNA transactions such as replication, gene expression, chro-
matin assembly and condensation, and cell division. It has been suggested that, together,
these modiﬁcations may form a complex, regulatory code: the so-called histone code.
Attempts to decipher this code are currently underway, using the aforementioned ChIP-
on-chip method with antibodies against speciﬁc histone modiﬁcations. The ﬁrst results
of this global analysis of histone modiﬁcations, in yeast and Drosophila, suggest very
similar genomic distributions of virtually all tested histone modiﬁcations; for example,
H3 and H4 acetylation and H3K4 di- and tri-methylation208. Moreover, most modiﬁca-
tions appeared to be positively correlated with gene expression.This suggests that the dif-
ferent histone maps are linked, pointing towards the absence of a complex regulatory
code of histone modiﬁcations. Multiple histone modiﬁcations employed in parallel to
control transcription might be another example of redundancy,conferring robustness on
transcriptional regulation. On the other hand, it is too early to rule out a role of histone
modiﬁcation patterns in the timing of speciﬁc gene activities.
How does the cell remember its epigenetic marks during cell division and how does
it remodel the epigenetic modiﬁcations inherited from the transcriptionally inactive
sperm and egg? Before a cell can divide, it must duplicate its DNA. In eukaryotes, this
occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. The process is schematically depicted in
74
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

Fig. 3.8. After a portion of the DNA is unwound by a helicase, a molecule of DNA
polymerase   binds to one strand of the DNA, moving along in the 3' →5' direction to
assemble a leading strand of nucleotides and reforming a double helix. Then, a second
DNA polymerase (polymerase  in eukaryotes) binds to the other template strand as the
double helix opens. It has to work the other way, because DNA synthesis can only occur 
5' →3'. This molecule must synthesize discontinuous segments of polynucleotides
(called Okazaki fragments).Another enzyme, DNA ligase I, then joins these together into
the lagging strand.Both leading and lagging strands need primers,generated by a primase.
The two DNA polymerases carrying out leading- and lagging-strand synthesis are locked
together in a replication machine with the DNA template for the lagging strand looping
out from the twin polymerases.
This mode of replication, predicted by Watson and Crick and so elegantly conﬁrmed
experimentally by Meselson and Stahl (Chapter 1), is described as semi-conservative:
one-half of each new molecule of DNA is old and one-half is new. Note that synthesis
using the 5' →3' strand as the template presents a special problem, which reveals yet
another vulnerability of the genome for aging-related alterations. As the replication fork
nears the end of the DNA, there is no longer enough template to continue forming
Okazaki fragments. So the 5' end of each newly synthesized strand cannot be completed
and each of the daughter chromosomes will have a shortened telomere. It is estimated
that each mitosis event costs human telomeres about 100 bp of DNA. This so-called end-
replication problem was recognized by Alexey Olovnikov in 1971, and independently by
James Watson a year later209.
An average 150-million-bp human chromosome can be copied within an hour
because of the many places where it can begin. Indeed, whereas bacteria have one single

speciﬁc origin of replication, eukaryotes can start replication at multiple origins on each
chromosome. DNA replication proceeds bidirectionally from an origin of replication;
that is, in opposite directions away from the origin (Fig. 3.7). At each cell cycle, during S
phase, duplication of chromatin structure, which involves both redistribution of
parental histones and histone neosynthesis, occurs in tight coordination with DNA
replication210. There are several ways to maintain DNA chromatin organization. First,
during DNA replication there are differences in replication timing. In general hete-
rochromatin replicates later than euchromatin. It is conceivable that partitioning the
genome into domains with speciﬁc replication times helps the cell to remember how to
distribute histones between the daughter strands.
Second, speciﬁc proteins, such as the chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) complex,
help in the assembly of nucleosomes onto newly replicated DNA. In this process, the pro-
liferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays an important role as a sliding clamp, serving
as a loading platform for many proteins involved in DNA replication (and DNA repair;
see Chapter 4). Once DNA and chromatin replication is complete, nuclear division
follows (see below).
Methylation patterns are perpetuated after replication by a maintenance methylase,
DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1211). Its importance is illustrated by the observation
that inactivation of this gene in the mouse is lethal. The enzyme acts on the hemimethy-
lated sites and converts them into fully methylated sites. Once DNA and chromatin
replication are complete, nuclear division follows (see below).
In the cell divisions that give rise to the zygote, a crucial step is the decondensation and
reorganization of chromatin of male and female gametes. This basically involves a largely
genome-wide erasure of the germ-line-speciﬁc epigenetic modiﬁcations that had
occurred during normal development in the embryonic primordial germ cell lineage212.
The identiﬁcation of epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms is a major current interest
in view of the fact that successful cloning of animals from differentiated adult cells by
somatic cell nuclear transfer also requires nuclear reprogramming. The latter is less suc-
cessful than the natural reprogramming of gamete DNA, as testiﬁed by the widespread
epigenetic defects in nuclear-transfer embryos213. A detailed discussion of this, as-yet
insufﬁciently explored, topic is beyond the scope of this book.
Of note,while occurring with exceptionally high ﬁdelity,the entire process of informa-
tion transmission during cell division, including gametogenesis and embryonic develop-
ment, is unlikely to be faultless, even under normal conditions in the absence of DNA
chemical insults or toxicants. Errors are minimized by different and overlapping mecha-
nisms (see Chapter 4), but cannot be entirely prevented. As mentioned in Chapter 2, in
germ cells, the DNA mutations resulting from such errors are the driving force behind
evolutionary change. Indeed, in times of stress, the propensity to mutate and to rapidly
create variants that can escape selection pressures facilitates survival of a small fraction of
the original population. However, in somatic cells they may lead to cellular degeneration
and death (Chapter 6).

3.3 Nuclear architecture
After this brief discussion of the primary and higher-order structure of the DNA of the
genome, it is important to review the physical space within which this complex set of
structure–function relationships unfolds. Evidence is rapidly emerging for a critical role
of nuclear architecture in determining gene activity. Nuclear architecture involves the
chromosomal positioning in the nuclear space. We have already seen that in interphase
cells the DNA of the genome is organized as linear chromosomes, which are really looped
30-nm solenoid ﬁbers, alternating with beads-on-a-string structures. How is this organ-
ized in the nuclear three-dimensional space and what are the functional consequences of
this organization?
The nucleus in eukaryotic cells is separated from the cytoplasm by a nuclear envelope
(nuclear membrane). The nuclear envelope consists of inner and outer membranes sepa-
rated by a perinuclear space (Fig. 3.9). The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with
the endoplasmic reticulum and has ribosomes attached. So the space between the inner
and outer membrane is directly connected to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. In
this way,ribosomal subunits and mRNA transcribed from genes in the DNA can leave the
nucleus, enter the endoplasmic reticulum, and participate in protein synthesis. Nuclear
pores are formed at sites where the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope
are joined.They allow free diffusion of small molecules as well as active transport through

the interaction between import or export signals (nuclear localization signals, or NLSs,
and nuclear export signals, or NESs, respectively) with receptors termed importins and
exportins. The ﬂuid within the nucleus is called nucleoplasm, which contains the linear
chromosomes.
The inner nuclear membrane is linked—by integral proteins—to the lamina, a ﬁbrous
meshwork composed of intermediate ﬁlament proteins called lamins (lamins A/C and B).
Lamins A and C arise from the same gene, LMNA, by alternative splicing. The lamins are
coiled-coil structures that contain a small N-terminal head followed by a rod-like domain
(-helical coiled-coil) and a C-terminal globular tail.Via the coiled-coil regions,lamins can
form parallel dimers, which in turn form polymers with other lamin dimers in an anti-
parallel manner (head-to-tail). The nuclear lamina is dynamic and can depolymerize
during mitosis and reform upon re-entry into interphase following rounds of phosphory-
lation and dephosphorylation at residues ﬂanking the lamin coiled-coil domains214.
Lamins at the nuclear periphery are thought to maintain nuclear shape. This becomes
apparent after treatment of cells with non-ionic detergents, a treatment that solubilizes
the vast majority of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. In such cases, electron-microscopic
images indicate that the nucleus of the treated cells retains its shape and the lamina remains
at the nuclear periphery215.Lamins are also dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm,form-
ing a thin ﬁbrillar network proposed to be major structural elements of the internal
nuclear matrix216 (Fig. 3.9).
Heritable mutations in lamin A/C or lamin-binding proteins cause various diseases.
For example, mutations in emerin (a lamin-binding protein) or A-type lamin cause
Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Mutations in LMNA can also cause Dunnigan-type
partial lipodystrophy or Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; see Chapter 5).
The mutations that cause these diseases are non-overlapping and it is still unclear as to
how different mutations in this gene can cause different diseases217. However, this is not
unprecedented. For example, mutations in the RET proto-oncogene can cause multiple
endocrine neoplasia and Hirschsprung disease218 and we will see in Chapter 4 that differ-
ent mutations in the XPD helicase gene can cause different diseases as well. Lamins may
contribute to tissue-speciﬁc gene expression, through their role as key elements in
nuclear architecture. Regions of chromatin appear to be anchored to the lamina and, at
least in vitro, lamins have been demonstrated to bind directly to chromatin.
As discussed in more detail in Chapter 5, children with HGPS are born normal but
start developing multiple symptoms of premature aging within 1 year. The gene product
resulting from the dominant mutation that gives rise to this disorder disrupts nuclear
architecture, which in a way that is still obscure is ultimately the cause of the disease.
Interestingly, in both human skin ﬁbroblast cell lines from old individuals219 and non-
neuronal tissues from aged nematodes220 progressive deterioration of nuclear lamina and
chromatin architecture has been observed. In the nematodes this degeneration was
delayed in the long-lived daf-2 mutants and accelerated in the short-lived daf-16 mutants.
78
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

Whereas there is no complete understanding as to how transcription or other 
DNA-dependent transactions, such as replication and repair, are distributed within the
nucleus, evidence is emerging that none of this is random. For example, whereas origi-
nally it was thought that the replication machinery was moving along the stationary
DNA, it is now considered more likely that replication is organized at ﬁxed positions in
so-called replication factories221. Likewise, various models have been proposed in which
RNA is transcribed on a solid substrate with an aggregate of all enzymes needed for tran-
scription, processing, and transport in place. Such a transcription-factory model implies
that different genes do not always assemble their own transcription sites de novo when
they become active, but instead migrate to such a pre-assembled association.
Compartmentalization of DNA-dependent transactions in the three-dimensional space
of the nucleus would be in keeping with the organization of other cellular processes, such
as the electron-transport chain in mitochondria, and is certainly a much more likely
model than the assumption that all these processes happen at random in solution.A good
candidate for such a solid support is the nuclear matrix, also termed nuclear scaffold,
nuclear cage, or nuclear skeleton.
The nuclear matrix is a meshwork of proteins that connects to the cytoskeleton at the
nuclear envelope. We have already seen that lamins could play a structural role in this
meshwork. It has been suggested that in the interphase nucleus the DNA, organized in
loops, is anchored to the nuclear matrix by means of non-coding sequences known as
matrix-attachment regions.These matrix-attachment regions may constitute boundaries
of independently controlled chromatin units within which the DNA packaging and
function may be changed without affecting the neighboring regions (see also below).
However, the existence of a nuclear matrix is controversial and an extensive meshwork of
ﬁlaments in the interchromatin space could simply be an experimental artifact222. In
contrast to the biochemically well characterized lamina, little is known about the protein
composition of the internal nuclear matrix. Others, however, argue that a nuclear matrix
is a readily observed cellular structure and that the concept of a matrix to provide
architectural support for higher-order chromatin packaging is sound223.
It is conceivable that chromatin is itself responsible for nuclear structure. In this
respect,emerging evidence suggests that the distribution of chromosomes in mammalian
interphase cell nuclei is non-random. Whereas the physically distinct nature of chromo-
somes is clearly visible during mitosis—when chromosomes condense and appear as
separate entities—the technique of chromosome painting demonstrated that also during
interphase each chromosome occupies a well-deﬁned nuclear sub-volume, called chro-
mosome territory224. In chromosome painting, probe sets for speciﬁc chromosomes,
labeled with different ﬂuorescent dyes, are hybridized to metaphase plates or interphase
cells so that each of the chromosomes shows a different color when viewed with a
ﬂuorescence microscope. Chromosome territories are non-randomly arranged within
the nuclear space and occupy preferential positions relative to the center of the nucleus

and relative to each other.Work by Tom Misteli and co-workers,who carried out a systematic
analysis of the spatial positioning of a subset of mouse chromosomes in several tissues,
suggests a pattern that is tissue-speciﬁc225.
The genes within chromosome territories appear to be non-randomly positioned rela-
tive to each other, or to nuclear landmarks, such as the nuclear envelope. An attractive
model has been presented in which the clustering of genes or other functional sequences
into contiguous regions of the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, termed neighbor-
hoods, is explained by similar requirements for optimal function, such as coordinated
and efﬁcient expression226.As yet, it is unclear whether this model is generally applicable,
but there are some intriguing examples of such potential compartmentalization. For
example, ribosomal genes cluster together in physical space due to the congregation of
the various chromosomes harboring the tandem arrays in which these genes occur, to
form the so-called nucleoli (Fig.3.8).Each nucleolus contains genetic material from mul-
tiple chromosomes.An area of DNA called the nucleolar organizer directs the synthesis of
rRNA, which subsequently combines with ribosomal proteins to form immature riboso-
mal subunits that mature in the cytoplasm after they leave the nucleus by way of the pores
in the nuclear envelope. Apart from nucleoli, other such compartments include Cajal
bodies, a congregation of small nuclear RNA and histone gene clusters, nuclear speckles
or spliceosomes, the so-called promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and, possi-
bly, repairosomes.
Interestingly, the gene-neighborhood model would indicate an additional concept of
gene position effects. That is, the actions of a gene are not only inﬂuenced by its position
in the one-dimensional DNA sequence, relative to regulatory elements, but also by its
particular location in the nucleus. Position effects here may include not only transcrip-
tion, but also replication, repair, and recombination. For example, when DNA undergoes
more than one DSB the spatial proximity of the broken ends is positively correlated with
the probability of illegitimate joining227.
Similar to the transmission of the DNA sequence and its methylation patterns and
histone code, nuclear compartmentalization must also be accurately perpetuated during
cell division to prevent cell death or phenotypic change.After generating two identical chro-
mosomes,termed sister chromatids,which remain attached at the centromere,nuclear divi-
sion begins with the prophase. In this stage the nucleolus disappears and the nuclear
envelope fragments. The latter happens, as mentioned already, by disassembling nuclear
lamins,which is regulated by their phosphorylation.The mitotic spindle begins to assemble
as the two centrosomes (duplicated just before mitosis) migrate away from each other until
they are on opposite sides of the nucleus. Each centrosome contains a pair of centrioles,
consisting of nine microtubule triplets surrounding a hollow cylinder. The centrioles are
replicated at the same time as the DNA is replicated, also in a semi-conservative manner;
that is, a daughter centriole grows out of the side of each parent centriole. The centrioles
may function to orientate the spindle and anchor the microtubules radiating out to the
80
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

chromosomes with some of them extending to the other pole. The point of connection on
each chromosome is the kinetochore, a protein complex in the constricted regions deﬁned
by the centromere. The centromeric satellite repeat sequences discussed above bind to the
kinetochore through speciﬁc proteins228.
During pro-metaphase the chromosomes are attached to the spindle and move to align
at the metaphase plate or equator of the spindle. During metaphase, nucleus and chro-
matin have essentially become spindle and sister-chromatid pairs, with the DNA at its
highest level of compaction. Mitosis has now reached the essential point, to correctly dis-
tribute identical chromosomes over the future daughter cells by pulling the sister chro-
matids of each pair toward opposite poles. This process is guided by a quality-control
mechanism called the mitotic spindle checkpoint. This checkpoint allows every chromo-
some to send a stop signal, arresting cell growth until all the chromosomes are appropri-
ately distributed. Defects in this checkpoint provoke chromosome mis-segregation and
aneuploidy (gain or loss of chromosomes), which can have adverse functional conse-
quences that include cell death and cancer. For example, defects in different components
of the mitotic spindle checkpoint have consistently been observed in cancer cells, charac-
terized by chromosomal instability. As described in detail in Chapter 5, partial inactiva-
tion of genes encoding proteins of the checkpoint machinery cause an increase in
aneuploidy and are associated with increased cancer and symptoms of accelerated aging.
In the anaphase, then, the two sister chromatids separate at the centromere and move
to opposite poles, driven by the depolymerization of microtubules at the kinetochores.
Finally, in the telophase the spindle disappears, the chromosomes decondense and the
nucleoli reappear. Also the nuclear envelope reforms and at the same time the lamins are
dephosphorylated and reassembled. It is unclear as yet what the exact role of lamins is in
assembly of the nuclear envelope.
3.4 Transcription regulation
The elaborate three-dimensional structure of our genome equipped with sophisticated
tools for the transfer of the information it contains, as described here, has developed over
the last 3–4 billion years since the emergence of our ancestors,the ﬁrst replicators.Its pur-
pose has never been any other than to make its information available for providing the
functions that ultimately serve its own perpetuation. This has resulted—through the
inevitable errors in the transmission of genetic information—in the spectacular level of
evolutionary diversity that can be witnessed all around us. The information encoded in
the genome is not solely the digital information specifying the amino acid sequences that
underlie the complicated protein machines that run our cells.More importantly,the code
dictates the time and place of protein expression as well as the interactions that result in
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
81

the regulatory networks that control the function of the molecular machines in the ﬁrst
place.Whereas protein expression can be regulated at various levels and through different
means, control at the gene-transcriptional level is by far the most important. It is at this
level of regulation where decisions are made as to why some proteins are expressed in one
tissue and not in others, why particular stimuli activate expression of a certain protein
and have no effect on others,and how the complex protein machines come together,often
acting in concert with many others, to execute their functions. It is also at this level where
we can expect to ﬁnd the most signiﬁcant adverse effects of the aging process, for
example, as a consequence of genomic alterations due to DNA damage or errors during
information transfer.
Our knowledge of transcription in the relatively simple prokaryotes is much deeper
than of that in eukaryotes, which have to operate in a less gene-dense genome.
Nevertheless,it is clear that in both types of species transcription regulation is fundamen-
tally similar, with more complexity and intricacy in eukaryotes. In prokaryotes transcrip-
tion and its regulation is dominated by operons, groups of adjacent, co-expressed, and
co-regulated genes that encode functionally interacting proteins (discovered by François
Jacob and Jacques Monod in the early 1960s). Operon transcripts always code for more
than one protein, and prokaryotes can start translation of the mRNA into amino acids
separately at the beginning of each protein-coding section. By contrast, in eukaryotes,
mRNA is not directly used in protein synthesis, but must undergo processing, including
the removal of introns, and the addition of a 7-methylguanylate cap structure at the 5'
end and a poly(A) tail at its 3' end, prior to export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,
where it is attached to the ribosomes for translation.
Whereas functionally related genes in eukaryotes are often clustered, eukaryotic tran-
scription machinery generally cannot handle polycistronic transcripts. Operons are rare
in eukaryotes, but the nematode C. elegans occasionally does make polycistronic tran-
scripts and can process them229. The myriad of processes that regulate transcription, in
both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, all converge on the promoter, a term introduced in
1964 by Jacob, Ullman, and Monod230 for a site on DNA that is upstream (5') to coding
sequences to which RNA polymerase will bind and initiate transcription. In contrast to
prokaryotes, which require only one kind of RNA polymerase, eukaryotes require three
RNA polymerases: RNA polymerase I synthesizes rRNA (90% of the RNA in a cell); (2)
RNA polymerase II synthesizes pre-messenger RNAs; and (3) RNA polymerase III is
responsible for the synthesis of tRNA,5 S RNA,and small nuclear RNA.RNA polymerase
II is the most delicately regulated eukaryotic RNA polymerase with an extensive need for
accessory proteins.
In prokaryotes the promoters of genes are approximately 200 bp long and consist of
two conserved regions, called 35 and 10, because they are approximately 35 and 10
nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site, which is called 	1 (base
number 1). The 10 region contains the so-called Pribnow box with a sequence similar
82
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

to 5'-TATAAT-3', which is one of the signals to initiate transcription. The expression level
of metazoan genes is regulated by the core promoter, cis-acting sequences, and trans-act-
ing factors.A prototypical metazoan promoter is assembled from a modular array of rela-
tively short sequence motifs (about 7–20 bp), each of which independently represents a
binding site for speciﬁc transcription regulatory proteins. The core promoter contains
DNA sequence elements that are recognized by the general transcription machinery,
which help to direct and orient the preinitiation complex at the promoter and play a crit-
ical role in the regulation of transcription (Fig. 3.10). The best characterized element is
the TATA element, an AT-rich sequence located about 25–35 bp upstream of the tran-
scription-initiation site (equivalent to the Pribnow box in bacteria), which is recognized
by the TATA-binding protein subunit of the transciption factor IID TFIID, initiating
preinitiation-complex formation. Other elements include the pyrimidine-rich initiator
element (INR), spanning the transcription start site, and the downstream promoter
element (DPE), which is recognized by components of TFIID other than TATA-binding
protein. Not all promoters contain all these elements. For example, the DPE is often
present in promoters that do not contain a TATA element. The strongest core promoters
contain both TATA and INR elements. Weaker core promoters, such as promoters of
housekeeping genes, expressed in all tissues at a low level, generally lack a TATA element,
an INR element, or both. Such differences in core promoter do not affect the assembly of
the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex.
Bacterial RNA polymerase can initiate transcription in vitro from a core promoter.
This is in contrast to eukaryotic RNA polymerases, which need initiation factors, termed
general transcription factors, that are required to assemble the stable transcriptional
complex needed for all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. Of these three polymerases,
RNA polymerase II is associated with a wide variety of regulatory events affecting the
genes transcribed by this enzyme. Also the general transcriptional complex for RNA
polymerase II contains far more components than the two other RNA polymerases. The
ﬁrst step in the formation of this complex is the binding of TFIID to the TATA box or

equivalent region, which is facilitated by TFIIA. TFIIB then joins the complex by binding
to TFIID, allowing the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the complex, in association
with TFIIF.Following polymerase binding,two other general transcription factors,TFIIE
and TFIIH, associate with the complex. TFIIH, which has a helicase activity, then
unwinds the double-stranded DNA,thereby permitting its being copied into RNA.TFIIH
is also important in DNA repair and genetic defects in the helicase component of this and
other proteins in mammals have been demonstrated to cause defects in DNA-repair
processes and are often associated with the premature appearance of symptoms of aging
(see Chapter 5).
In metazoa,recruitment of the general transcription factors to the core promoter com-
pletes the formation of the preinitiation complex. This allows low levels of accurate tran-
scription in vitro, but not in vivo. In vivo transcription utilizes binding sites for
transcription factors231, which can function as activators or repressors. Whereas the core
promoter with its preinitiation complex of RNA polymerase II provides the basic
machinery of transcription, it is the ensemble of transcription factors that orchestrates
the patterns of gene expression in an organism. Within eukaryotes there is a great variety
in the number of transcription factors, reﬂecting the differences in complexity. In yeast,
there are about 300 transcription factors, including subunits of general transcription
complexes such as TFIID. C. elegans and Drosophila have at least 1000 transcription
factors, with as many as 3000 in humans. Transcription factors are structurally organized
as combinations of a regulatory domain (for activation or repression) with a DNA-bind-
ing domain. Examples of DNA-binding domains are the helix-turn-helix domain, the
homeodomain, the zinc-ﬁnger domain, the winged helix domain, and the leucine zipper
domain.
Many transcription-factor-binding sites are within about 200 bp upstream of the core
promoter,an area referred to as the proximal promoter.There are binding sites here for at
least three types of transcription activation.First,constitutive elements,such as Sp1,bind
transcription factors for ubiquitously expressed genes, such as housekeeping genes.
Second, inducible elements bind transcription factors that are involved in responses to
intra- or extracellular signals, such as the heat-shock-response element and steroid-
response elements.Third,tissue-speciﬁc elements bind transcription factors that regulate
the expression of tissue-speciﬁc genes.An example is the CArG element, a motif repeated
four times within the proximal promoter of the human  cardiac actin gene and respon-
sible for heart- and muscle-speciﬁc transcription.
Other cis-acting sequences are often much further away from the core promoter.
Examples are enhancers, which are sequence elements located upstream, downstream, or
within a transcription unit that can inﬂuence the level of gene expression by increasing
the activity of a promoter. A special group of enhancer elements is a so-called locus-
control region, which regulates the expression of functional gene clusters, such as the 
84
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION


-globin gene cluster in the red-blood-cell lineage. Finally, there are silencer elements,
which act to inhibit gene transcription, and insulator or boundary sequences, which
prevent enhancers associated with one gene from inappropriately regulating neighboring
genes.All these cis-regulatory sequences can be scattered over distances as great as 100 kb
in mammals (Fig. 3.11).
How do transcription factors activate or repress transcription from the core promoter
in the context of all these regulatory sequences? This comes down to the question of how
transcription-factor binding to a recognition site that is often some distance away from
the core promoter conveys its activation or repression signal to the general-transcription-
factor-based transcription-initiation complex at the site of the core promoter. Whereas
there are some examples of direct interaction between transcription factors and general
transcription factors, indirect interaction through co-activators and co-repressors seems
to be the norm. Co-activators or co-repressors provide a connection between the tran-
scription factors and the preinitiation complex. There are different classes of transcrip-
tional co-regulator, some intrinsic to components of the core machinery, others
facilitating enhancer–promoter contact, sometimes over large distances. This requires
looping between a gene and a distal enhancer, which is determined by higher-order DNA
structure. This indicates the importance of cofactors that can alter this higher-order
structure. Many transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors have now been identiﬁed
as factors that either covalently modify the N-termini of core histones through phospho-
rylation, acetylation, or methylation, or actively effect nucleosome positioning. For
example,gene-speciﬁc transcriptional activation often involves the targeting of two types
of chromatin-remodeling enzyme to the core promoter: histone acetyl transferase (HAT)
and the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF-like complex232. HATs have been demonstrated to

mediate transcription activation through acetylation of histones, whereas histone
deacetylases (HDACs) can do the opposite. HATs and HDACs may work through the
recruitment of other, non-histone chromatin proteins, which subsequently remodel
chromatin. SWI/SNF is itself an ATP-driven chromatin remodeling complex that can act
to repress a gene or relieve nucleosome-mediated repression of promoters, permitting
the assembly of the preinitiation complex. These two types of transcriptional cofactor
may act synergistically to establish a local chromatin structure that is permissive for
transcription.
Apart from transcription factors and their cofactors, two other layers of transcription
control are likely to be important. First, DNA methylation at CpG sites has already been
mentioned as a major marker for stable transcriptional repression. How does DNA
methylation silence genes and how ﬂexible is it? Recent results suggest that the repressive
action of methylation may also be ascribed to chromatin remodeling. Likely mediators
of methylation-dependent shutdown of gene expression are the proteins belonging to
the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family. These proteins interact speciﬁcally
with methylated CpG dinucleotides and one of them, MeCP2, has been associated with
chromatin-modiﬁcation enzymes, including HDAC, as well as with the SWI/SNF
complex. Binding of MeCP2 near the promoter would lock a gene in a repressive state
through chromatin remodeling. Activation of the gene could occur through the loss of
the CpG methylation that holds the MeCP2 at the promoter or, alternatively, through the
modiﬁcation of this protein, thereby facilitating its release207.
Finally, during the last few years, regulatory RNAs have been linked to transcriptional
silencing. The role of the Xist long non-coding RNA in silencing the X chromosome
through the promotion of large heterochromatic domains and DNA methylation has
already been discussed. Among the small, antisense non-coding RNAs, miRNAs are now
rapidly emerging as an extensive regulatory network controlling tissue-speciﬁc and
development-related gene expression in higher organisms. miRNAs are thought to inter-
act with a mRNA, by binding to partially complementary sites in its 3' untranslated
region, and either trigger its destruction or repress its translation. It is possible that as
many as 30% of all human genes are regulated by miRNAs233. Some genes can be regu-
lated by multiple miRNAs. However, preventing mRNA translation through direct inter-
action may not be the only mode of action of miRNAs in transcription silencing. At least
in plants evidence has been obtained that miRNAs can act by mediating DNA methyla-
tion and heterochromatin formation. The mechanism of this interesting RNA feedback
to the genome is unknown, but it may work through the activation of DNA methyltrans-
ferase and the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes.
The above makes it clear that transcription is regulated by transcription factors inter-
acting with the core promoter of a gene through the action of a large variety of cofactors.
Key mechanisms of transcription regulation are histone modiﬁcations and chromatin
remodeling, indicating the importance of DNA higher-order structure and chromosomal
86
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

positioning in determining the expression level of a gene. An important aspect of
transcriptional control that has become apparent only relatively recently is its reliance on
DNA sequences spread through three-dimensional space of the nucleus. Indeed, one-
dimensional physical distances between genes or between genes and some of their regula-
tory sequences are not a hindrance for coordinated activation and repression of their
activities.It is possible that different genes can extend out of their chromosome territories
to access one of the shared transcription factories mentioned above (Fig. 3.12). This is
very similar to the looping-out mechanisms proposed for long-range action of distal
regulatory elements, such as an enhancer or locus control sequence (Fig. 3.13)234.
The examination of long-range control of gene transcription has been greatly facili-
tated by the emergence of novel methods, such as the chromosome conformation
capture, or 3C, method and the tagging and recovery of associated proteins, or RNA trap
assay234.Similar to the ChIP-on-chip assay,these methods also rely on formaldehyde ﬁxa-
tion of cells or tissues and the subsequent identiﬁcation of the DNA sequence captured by
the cross-linked chromatin. Using these methods, chromatin-loop interactions between
enhancers and their target promoters,often tens of kilobases away,have now been conclu-
sively demonstrated.
Some enhancers have been found at distances of up to 1 Mb from their gene target,
which underscores the need to limit their action (which is usually promiscuous) to their
target genes only.As already mentioned, a gene or gene cluster can achieve certain auton-
omy through the establishment of chromatin boundaries. One way of creating such
boundaries is through the action of speciﬁc DNA sequences and associated proteins,
termed boundary or insulator sequences (Fig.3.11).Such sequences are also important in

halting the spread of transcriptionally repressive condensed chromatin structures.
Long-range gene-regulatory interactions and the organization of the genome in active
chromatin domains immediately explain the large variability in transgene expression lev-
els normally observed after integration of a gene-expression construct at diverse chromo-
somal positions. Disruption of long-range regulatory action, for example, as a
consequence of deletions or other types of genome rearrangement, can result in gene-
expression alterations. Indeed, position-independence of gene expression is lost when
one essential cis-regulatory region is deleted235.The possibility that this type of event con-
tributes to increased aging-related stochasticity of gene expression will be discussed in
Chapter 7.
In summary,gene-transcription regulation depends on the three-dimensional interac-
tion of a large variety of DNA sequences—which are not limited to the immediate vicin-
ity of a gene—interacting with a multitude of protein and RNA cofactors. Transcription
activation and repression through these cofactors appear to depend on higher-order
DNA structure, with most of the genome in a permanently repressed, heterochromatin
state. This view of gene-transcription regulation signiﬁcantly differs from earlier ideas
and has immediate relevance for potential mechanisms of aging-related cellular dysfunc-
tion. Indeed, the enormous advantage of having so many factors impacting on the
transcriptional activity of a gene, often in parallel, is the opportunity to provide redun-
dancy as well as ﬁne regulation of cellular function. However, it also creates a myriad of
access points to bring about slight, but cumulative, defects that may ultimately adversely
affect function.

3.5 Conclusions
Almost ﬁve decades after it was ﬁrst postulated that we age because our genomes age,
what can we learn from this brief overview of our most recent insights into the genome’s
structure and functional organization? For decades, attention has been focused on a
genome consisting primarily of protein-coding genes without seriously considering a
function for the vast majority of DNA sequences in our genome, which do not encode
proteins, but are often transcribed. It is only very recently that this focus has shifted to
non-coding DNA sequences, RNA-coding DNA, their transcripts, and their possible role
in the systems engineering process that operates our genomes as the information
organelles that control development and functional maintenance in adulthood.
The ﬁrst lesson clearly is the realization that in this vast amount of functional primary
sequence, with the extra dimensions of higher-order DNA and nuclear architecture,
errors—some signiﬁcant, many subtle—are inevitable. This is especially true during the
perpetuation of the entire structure during cell division, including those divisions that
lead to the zygote and its development into an adult.We can see the consequences of such
errors already at a very early stage. In humans, chromosomal aberrations and possibly
other types of mutation are responsible for the vast majority of spontaneous abortions
and still births. This is in spite of the selection opportunity to eliminate genetically aber-
rant germ cells. The fact that most of the time adverse effects of genomic errors are not
immediately obvious, at least not during development and early adulthood, does not
mean there are no genomic errors or that their effects are unimportant.The difﬁculties in
detecting small differences in organismal ﬁtness limit the identiﬁcation of subtle effects,
which may be especially important in somatic cells on the long term. As we can deduce
from Chapter 2, heritable deﬁciencies in maintaining the genome code causing harmful
effects only at old age are not eliminated by natural selection.
A second lesson that can be learnt from our current insights is the highly sophisticated
manner with which the genome regulates its transactions,resulting in unprecedented lev-
els of precision. Yet one cannot escape the notion that this entire symphony of cellular
function is in some way inefﬁcient, with multiple, often overlapping and haphazard, lev-
els of control. This serves as another reminder that evolution does not work as a designer
that pursues a long-term plan for the most straightforward operational system. The way
we now understand Darwinian evolution gives us reason to expect complex, sometimes
messy, interactions between all possible levels of genome functioning, including tran-
scription regulation, maintenance and replication. The system, in spite of its many safe-
guards, including active repair, redundancy, and mechanisms for cell elimination,
certainly has not been designed to last the ages.
Finally, from what we have seen, the genome’s Achilles heel seems to reside in its need
to provide function through transcription. Maintenance of both the DNA primary
sequence and the higher-order regulatory punctuation of the genome are critically
GENOME STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
89

important for its long-term performance in delivering the right protein at the right time
in the right place. As we shall see, in spite of the sophistication of genome-control sys-
tems, it is not going to meet this requirement for very much longer than strictly necessary
to perpetuate itself. Indeed, threats to its integrity come from both outside and from
within, with chemical DNA damage the most prominent source of genomic errors. This
becomes apparent when genetic defects,from subtle to severe,predispose the organism to
making mistakes. In the next chapter I will discuss the many overlapping systems that are
available to correct chemical damage to the DNA of the genome.

Genome maintenance
Genomes exist by virtue of their capacity to self-replicate as the key attributes for organis-
mal perpetuation.Whereas the possibility of genetic errors has been recognized since the
discovery of the DNA double helix, the magnitude of lapses in information transfer was
not immediately clear. Indeed, a major hindrance in gaining a full understanding of the
potential impact of genome instability on a living organism was the initial lack of insight
into the mechanisms by which genomes may disintegrate over time and the factors inﬂu-
encing such process. Only in the early 1960s, after the discovery of excision repair in
bacteria by Richard Setlow (Upton, NY, USA)236, later conﬁrmed by Boyce and Howard-
Flanders237, did suspicion arise that spontaneous DNA alterations would be much more
frequent, were it not for the continuous monitoring of the genome for changes in DNA
chemical structure. Once the critical importance of maintaining genome integrity was
realized, the concept was borne that the genes specifying genome maintenance may
belong to a category of genes called longevity-assurance genes238,239. However, at the
time, the enormous complexity of the various interconnected systems for detecting and
repairing damage to the genome was still unknown240.
Genome maintenance is a general term and includes systems for sensing and signal-
ing the presence of DNA damage, the repair of such damage or its tolerance, as well as
the proper reconstruction of DNA higher-order structure after repair is completed. It
also includes systems to continuously monitor the key processes of genome informa-
tion transfer, from DNA replication to mitosis, to prevent or correct errors and in a
broad sense also those molecules and enzymes that act to prevent damage to the genome
or buffer its adverse effects. The core of the genome is of course DNA and a major source
of genome instability is the continuous introduction of lesions in this molecule by a
variety of exogenous and endogenous physical, chemical, and biological agents. The
removal of such lesions occurs through DNA repair and is considered so important that
DNA repair and genome maintenance are often used as synonyms. I will do that too,
occasionally.
As we have seen in Chapter 3, DNA is a very stable molecule. However, under physio-
logical conditions, DNA readily reacts with a variety of agents, most notably water and
oxygen, to gradually disintegrate. Damage to the genome, resulting in errors in its infor-
mation content, is not something that has emerged over time in modern organisms,
but has from the beginning been intricately associated with life as the driver of evolution-
ary change (see Chapter 2). The ﬁrst replicating nucleic acids, probably RNAs, evolved
over 3.5 billion years ago in an environment with little molecular oxygen. The absence

of an ozone layer around the primitive earth would have subjected any exposed early
replicators to high ﬂuxes of damaging ultraviolet radiation. Once initiated, life based on
nucleic acids had to cope with the problem of maintaining a balance between a sufﬁcient
amount of genetic variation and its integrity as an individual entity; it had to balance
evolvability against longevity. Probably the most ancient longevity genes selected must
have been those involved in catalyzing the chemical reactions useful to maintaining the
genomes of the individual protocells sufﬁciently long for them to multiply and compete
with other individual protocells. Hence, some form of DNA repair was essential from the
very beginning,which is reﬂected by the wide diversity of genome-maintenance pathways
in all current species.
Since all organisms are derived from a common ancestor, with new species arising by a
splitting of one population into two or more populations that do not cross-breed, the
evolutionary relationship of systems such as DNA repair can be studied by creating evolu-
tionary trees of gene sequence data.As discussed in Chapter 1, such phylogenetic analysis
is greatly facilitated by the availability of complete sequence information on the genomes
of a great many species in all three kingdoms of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The
evolutionary history of DNA-repair enzymes is complex and characterized by extensive
gene duplication, gene loss, and horizontal (also termed lateral) gene transfer between
species. In horizontal transfer genetic information is passed on, not just to progeny but to
other individuals in the same population or even to members of other species.When this
occurs,the introduced gene brings into the cell its own history,which does not reﬂect that
of the host cell.An extreme case of horizontal transfer took place about 1 billion years ago
when Eubacteria entered into a symbiosis with Archaea-type host cells to become the
mitochondria of eukaryotes201. This explains why some eukaryotic DNA-repair proteins
can be traced to bacterial and archaeal roots.
Another characteristic of the evolutionary history of DNA repair is the relative scarcity of
DNA-repair proteins that are truly universal across the three kingdoms. It is possible that
truly universal DNA-repair proteins—present in the last common ancestral genome—are
limited to a RecA-like recombinase, a few helicases, nucleases, and ATPases241. There are
profound differences in core replicative enzymes (but not the Y-family polymerases, which
are bona ﬁde homologs in bacteria and eukaryotes; see below),which is in striking contrast
with the universal conservation of the translation machinery. It is possible that such differ-
ences in DNA-repair enzymes between the three kingdoms reﬂect early changes in both
internal and external environment,requiring new DNA-repair functions.
Genome maintenance may have been the ﬁrst system that became subject to natural
selection because of its critical importance to life as we know it242. Originally the most
ancient DNA-repair systems may have functioned in protecting an RNA-based ancestral
cell.The inherent instability of RNA—because of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group of
ribose, making its phosphodiester bonds very susceptible to hydrolysis—could have been
the primary reason for the transition to a DNA/protein world, which eventually
92
GENOME MAINTENANCE

permitted the evolution to complex,multicellular organisms.Genome maintenance,now
to a large extent driven by DNA-damage signaling and repair processes, remained of the
utmost importance as a cellular defense mechanism.This is evident from the large invest-
ment that cells make in DNA-repair enzymes, with several percent of the coding capacity
of organisms devoted solely to DNA-repair functions. In some cases, one entire protein
molecule is sacriﬁced for the removal of a single lesion.
Whereas random changes occur in all biological macromolecules, either as errors in
their synthesis or from the reaction with environmental or endogenous damaging agents,
the consequences for the DNA of the genome are especially dire. For most biopolymers,
including RNA, proteins, and lipids, the effects of damage or synthetic errors are mini-
mized by turnover and replacement of altered molecules. DNA is distinctive in that its
information content must be transmitted virtually intact from one cell to another during
cell division or reproduction of an organism.Moreover,even in non-dividing cells,major
portions of the genome are continuously needed as regulated templates to carry out
speciﬁc functions. It is not surprising, therefore, that defects in genome-maintenance
systems are incompatible with normal life. Such defects are often embryonically lethal
and defective or diminished DNA-repair capacity can cause disease,including cancer,and
accelerate normal symptoms of aging (see below and Chapter 5).
The speciﬁc need of DNA for stability is satisﬁed by the various genome-maintenance
pathways, which will be reviewed in this chapter with a focus on eukaryotes and mam-
malian cells. Similar to Chapter 3, this overview is not exhaustive and mainly serves in
providing the context for the main purpose of this book: to sketch the rationale for
genome alterations as a possible molecular basis of aging. For more detailed information
the reader is referred to the excellent textbook, DNA Repair and Mutagenesis, by
Friedberg, Walker, Siede, Wood, Schultz and Ellenberger240 and several recent reviews
referred to in the text.
4.1 Why genome maintenance?
The unique position of the DNA of the genome among biological macromolecules, that
is, its lack of opportunities to easily replace the genetic information primarily embedded
in its sequences through natural turnover like proteins and lipids, does not automatically
imply the need for advanced maintenance systems. Indeed, genome integrity can be pro-
tected through redundancy,when the same function can be performed by other,identical
elements, and degeneracy, when elements that are structurally different are able to per-
form the same function. It is also possible that large sections of the genome are dispensa-
ble, which is suggested, but not proven, by the generation of viable mice homozygous for
large deletions of the non-coding DNA referred to as gene deserts243.
GENOME MAINTENANCE
93

However, structural redundancy and degeneracy of a genome are apparently not
enough to survive natural levels of DNA damage. This is illustrated by the bacterium
Deinococcus radiodurans. This organism is extremely resistant to ionizing radiation and
many other agents that damage DNA.This is likely to be an adaptation to extreme desicca-
tion followed by rehydration, which causes very high levels of DNA damage. This bac-
terium is highly polyploid (4–10 genome equivalents), which would provide it with
additional gene copies to complement inactivated ones.However,this is likely not the main
function of the polyploidy. Instead, this form of redundancy serves to increase the efﬁ-
ciency of homologous recombination (HR) repair, and not primarily to provide back-up
copies of genes.In fact,apart from the polyploidy,there is also a redundancy in DNA-repair
functions244. Indeed, almost all possible repair mechanisms that have been identiﬁed in
prokaryotes,many of them overlapping,are encoded in the genome of D. radiodurans.The
genetic cost of maintaining genome function solely by structural redundancy (creating
back-up copies of all possible genetically encoded functions) is apparently too high, illus-
trating the magnitude of the problem. Structural redundancy can also be dangerous, for
example, because it could cause undesirably high levels of gene expression or, in verte-
brates,promote the activation of oncogenes when more copies of such genes are available.
DNA repair is desperately needed because damage to the genome is a very frequent
event, with all organisms continuously exposed to a large variety of genotoxic agents. UV
radiation has already been mentioned as a major exogenous DNA-damaging agent, espe-
cially relevant during the early stages of life in the absence of an ozone layer. Modern
humans are also exposed to UV radiation in the form of sunlight, but to other agents as
well, including ionizing radiation and a range of genotoxic chemicals in our environ-
ment, including dietary components and air-borne pollutants. However, the main reason
for all organisms to invest so heavily in DNA repair involves an enemy from within rather
than from outside. All organisms dependent on water and oxygen for their existence are
continuously threatened by endogenous DNA damage. It has been estimated that many
thousands of spontaneous lesions are induced in the DNA of the genome of a cell each
day, solely as a consequence of hydrolysis. Another major endogenous source of sponta-
neous DNA damage in aerobic organisms is oxidation. Oxidation, as we have seen, was
ﬁrst recognized by Denham Harman as a logical explanation for the various forms of cell
and tissue damage observed to occur during aging23,74,245. As by-products of oxidative
phosphorylation and other biological and physiological processes, oxygen radicals can
inﬂict a variety of damages on cellular DNA and other biological macromolecules like
proteins and lipids. The lesions induced in DNA by free radicals are diverse and include a
variety of adducts246 as well as abasic sites, cross-links, DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs)
and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Figure 4.1 schematically depicts the different
types of DNA chemical damage that can be induced by exogenous and endogenous
agents: inter- or intra-chromosomal cross-links,DNA SSBs or DSBs,and a variety of base
adducts subdivided into bulky and small adducts.
94
GENOME MAINTENANCE

Many DNA lesions, including the ubiquitous oxidative base alterations, have been
identiﬁed and measured in mammals, both upon their induction in the DNA and as
adducts, often as excretion products in the urine of rodents or humans. The excretion of
adducts is a result of their excision by DNA-repair systems247. Hence, spontaneous DNA
damage reﬂects a steady-state situation and is generally not permanent.

In principle, DNA damage can result in three main types of adverse effect (Fig. 4.2).
First, DNA damage can interfere with transcription. Second, DNA damage can initiate
the cellular signals that lead to programmed cell death (apoptosis) or permanent cessa-
tion of mitotic activity: replicative senescence. Third, DNA damage can have long-term
effects in the form of mutations: irreversible alterations in DNA sequence information.
These consequences often depend on various factors, such as the type of cell, the stage of
differentiation or the stage of the cell cycle,the amount and type of DNA damage,and the
genomic location of the damage, for example, transcribed or non-transcribed DNA
sequences, repeat elements or unique sequences. The events that may lead from these
lesions to the aging phenotype are discussed in detail in the following chapters. What is
clear, however, is that without efﬁcient systems to rapidly address genome structural
deﬁciencies and restore the original situation, spontaneous DNA damage would soon
overwhelm the cell and result in a total collapse of its functional integrity.
Genome maintenance can be roughly subdivided into two components: DNA-damage
signaling and DNA repair per se, including tolerance (Fig. 4.3). Whereas DNA-damage
signaling is primarily involved in orchestrating a large variety of cellular responses to
DNA damage,DNA repair is a straightforward damage-removal system.Both branches of
genome maintenance require proteins to recognize or sense the damage, which then in
turn recruit other proteins to carry out the task at hand, being the signaling of a cellular
response or a given repair activity. As described in Chapter 3, many of these proteins are
kept at storage sites, which may include nucleoli, telomeres, and PML bodies. Upon dam-
age inﬂiction these proteins undergo intranuclear relocalization and translocate to
nuclear foci thought to represent sites of DNA damage and repair; such sites are some-
times called repairosomes.
As yet, little is known about the exact mechanisms of damage recognition and the
nature of the sensors for various types of damage. Indeed, considering the fact that a
diploid genome comprises about 2 m of DNA, how is the cell alerted to the presence of

damage? As we will see, there are indirect ways of ‘seeing’ DNA damage, but the problem
of ﬁnding a DNA lesion by a repair or signaling protein can to some extent be generalized
by comparing it with the recognition of speciﬁc DNA sequences by transcription factors
or restriction endonucleases. In this context a model has been developed, termed facili-
tated diffusion, in which the protein ﬁrst binds DNA non-speciﬁcally and then slides
towards its target along the DNA molecule.Already in 1965 Hanawalt and Haynes postu-
lated that DNA-damage recognition was based on proteins that they compared to ‘close-
ﬁtting sleeves’,through which the DNA was threaded to detect deviations from the formal
Watson and Crick structure248. However, it is unlikely that such models reﬂect reality and
it is now considered more likely that damage recognition involves an iterative process of
transient binding and dissociation. It is possible that the repair enzymes initially recog-
nize discontinuity of the DNA double helix due to base unstacking,kinking,or nucleotide
extrusion249.For lesions such as DNA breaks the recognition process may be different and
based on chromatin distortion. It is as yet unclear whether the recognition process of
DNA damage is similar for DNA repair and DNA damage signaling. Whereas in DNA-
repair damage is recognized through speciﬁc protein–DNA interactions, the DNA-
damage sensors activating cellular responses to the damage are more general since they
must respond to a wide variety of damage as well as problems during replication.Overlap
between these two branches of genome maintenance in terms of damage recognition is
nevertheless conceivable.

pathways assists in these repair activities or activates cellular responses that kill or terminate
mitotic activity of a cell when it is beyond repair. The elements of the two pathways depicted on
the ﬁgure are discussed later in this chapter. ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated.

4.2 DNA-damage signaling and cellular responses
Whereas the details of the initial stages of DNA-damage signaling are not clear, it is
assumed that the presence of most lesions is detected by sensor proteins that convey the
damage signals to transducers, transmitting them to numerous downstream effectors.
The signaling mechanism, which depends on the type of damage and whether or not
the DNA sequence is transcribed, has thus far been approached almost exclusively from
the perspective of the actively proliferating cell with a strong focus on the concept of
cell-cycle checkpoints, introduced by Hartwell and Weinert250. Originally, a cell-cycle
checkpoint was deﬁned as a regulatory pathway that controls the order and timing of
cell-cycle transitions by checking at the beginning of each new step whether the previ-
ous one is completed. For our present discussion this basically involves an examination
of genome integrity at speciﬁc points in the cell cycle. Upon sensing the damage, mech-
anisms are activated that arrest cell-cycle progression at checkpoints in the G1/S, intra-
S,or G2/M phases to allow time for repair.This somewhat narrow concept of DNA-damage
checkpoints has now been extended to include the whole range of cellular responses to
DNA damage, which comprise: (1) activation of checkpoints to allow time for repair;
(2) recruitment of and/or participation in various damage-repair systems; (3) activa-
tion of systems for damage tolerance; (4) activation of programmed cell death or
replicative senescence to eliminate the affected cell or prevent it from further replica-
tion; and (5) the activation of a host of stress-response genes, the function of which is
still far from clear.
Since cultured, actively proliferating cells, often in the form of bacteria, yeast, or mam-
malian cell lines, have become our major model systems in cell biology, a bias towards
studying DNA damage and repair in cycling cells is not surprising. However, most tissues
in vivo contain a very small number of cells in the S phase or no proliferating cells at all,and
even stem cells, the presence of which in some normal adult tissues has now been amply
conﬁrmed, exist mainly in a quiescent state. Recently, evidence emerged for cell-cycle
activation and apoptosis in postmitotic neurons upon treatment with genotoxic agents251.
While intriguing,the generality of such mechanisms remains to be demonstrated.
Below, I will brieﬂy summarize our current knowledge as to the nature of the various
DNA-damage-sensing and -signaling mechanisms and how they interact with the multi-
protein complexes specialized in different DNA-repair pathways.
4.2.1 ATM/ATR-DEPENDENT CHECKPOINTS
An important role in the damage signaling process is played by the DNA-damage-
inducible phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family. For example, the
presence of the highly toxic DNA DSBs in mammalian cells is often signaled by the ataxia
98
GENOME MAINTENANCE

telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase,which phosphorylates proteins that initiate cell-cycle
arrest,apoptosis,and DNA repair.Humans lacking functional ATM suffer from a syndrome
called ataxia telangiectasia, characterized by cerebellar neurodegeneration, immunodeﬁ-
ciency, extreme sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and increased susceptibility to cancer.
Ataxia telangiectasia is sometimes considered as a segmental progeroid syndrome, a
disease characterized by the premature appearance of multiple symptoms of aging. As
we will see in Chapter 5, most of these syndromes are caused by heritable mutations in
genes involved in genome maintenance, by itself evidence that genome instability is a
causal factor in aging.
Since DSBs are so toxic,ATM is ever present near the DNA,albeit in an inactive dimeric
state or as a higher-order multimer. Inactive ATM dimers are converted into catalytically
active monomers, through autophosphorylation, which leads to dimer dissociation and
the initiation of cellular ATM kinase activity within minutes of exposure to an agent that
induces DSBs, such as ionizing radiation. According to one model, a DSB causes alter-
ations in chromatin structure that can affect very large regions of genomic DNA, thereby
activating hundreds of ATM molecules252. However, at least in vitro, ATM activation
appears to be dependent on the Mre11–Rad50–Nbs1 (MRN) complex, which may sense
the DSBs, recruit ATM, and dissociate the ATM dimer253. How MRN does this is unclear
but it may also involve a conformational alteration. Of note, MRN unwinds the DNA
ends of a break to generate single-stranded DNA, which is essential for ATM stimulation.
This is of interest since the activation of ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase also
requires single-stranded DNA (see below),which is an evolutionarily conserved signal for
DNA damage. Whereas the exact mechanism of ATM activation is still debated there is
general consensus that, once activated, ATM activates downstream cellular targets, such
as p53 and Chk2, through phosphorylation.
Another PIKK, the ATR kinase, has a broader speciﬁcity and participates in responses
to a wide range of DNA damage, probably exclusively during the cell cycle in response to
replication blockage. Unlike ATM,ATR is essential for both embryonic development and
somatic cell growth. ATR exists as a complex with ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP),
which is recruited to DNA single-stranded regions coated by replication protein A
(RPA)254. Most DNA-repair pathways process DNA damage through RPA–single-
stranded DNA intermediates and stalled replication forks expose extended regions of
RPA–single-stranded DNA. Once recruited, ATR activates other checkpoint proteins
through phosphorylation, including proteins of the 9–1–1 and Rad17–replication factor
C (RFC) complexes (see below) and claspin.The latter,in complex with the breast cancer-
susceptibility protein BRCA1, is required for the ATR/ATRIP-dependent phosphoryla-
tion of Chk1. All these checkpoint proteins must be recruited independently. Eventually,
ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 and p53 helps to stabilize stalled replication
forks by establishing arrest at critical cell-cycle checkpoints, including intra-S- and G2/
M-phase checkpoints, and possibly signals apoptosis.
GENOME MAINTENANCE
99

By comparing different sources of DNA damage—oxidative stress, ionizing radiation,
and UV radiation—it has been demonstrated that the ATM and ATR pathways overlap.
However, regardless of the genotoxic agent, ATM or ATR always phosphorylated the
checkpoint proteins p53, Chk1, and Chk2. These proteins are important transducers of
the damage-response signal to effector proteins, including p21 and Cdc25A, that ﬁnally
result in arrest at critical cell-cycle checkpoints. Thus, for all three sources of damage, the
downstream targets for phosphorylation are similar; rather,it is the requirement for ATM
or ATR that is different. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that the ATM and ATR
kinases each evolved to respond to unique forms of genotoxic stress255.
While primarily regulating checkpoint activation in response to DNA DSBs, there is
evidence that ATM is also directly involved in the repair of such breaks by activating
component proteins of the process of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ; see
below)256. In addition,ATM may function in the maintenance of the telomeres, described
in the previous chapter and further below, that cap the ends of chromosomes. It may do
this through direct binding to short telomeres, phosphorylation of telomere-binding
proteins, or other types of regulation of telomere proteins257 (see also Chapter 5).
4.2.2 DNA-PK
Another member of the PIKK family of kinases involved in sensing and signaling of DNA
damage in response to genotoxic insult is the DNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PK,
best known for its role in NHEJ. DNA-PK is composed of a large catalytic subunit, DNA-
PKCS,and the Ku70–Ku80 dimer with high afﬁnity for DNA ends,which guides the kinase
subunit to the site of the damage, usually a DSB. DNA-PKCS homologs are present in all
vertebrates, but not in invertebrates, such as yeast, nematodes, and fruit ﬂies, in contrast
to other PIKK family members,such as ATM and ATR.Apart from its role in NHEJ,DNA-
PKCS acts as a genuine DNA-damage sensor,transmitting signals to p53,to regulate apop-
tosis and cell-cycle arrest, or mediate the recruitment of DNA-repair complexes258. There
is evidence that DNA-PK activity in rodent cells is much lower than in human cells259,
which could point towards some role of the protein in determining lifespan differences
between species (see further below). Interestingly, a fourth member of the PIKK family is
the target of rapamycin (TOR), a kinase that, as we have seen in Chapter 2, plays a role in
nutrient sensing. Its downregulation extends lifespan in the ﬂy and the worm, but it
seems to play no role in DNA-damage sensing or signaling.
4.2.3 THE 9–1–1 COMPLEX
Another possible DNA-damage sensor is the heterotrimeric complex of Rad9, Rad1,
and Hus1, known as the 9–1–1 complex. The complex is targeted to the nucleus and
to sites of damaged DNA following genotoxic stress. The complex is structurally similar
100
GENOME MAINTENANCE

to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the sliding DNA clamp encountered in
Chapter 3 in relation to DNA replication,and it is loaded onto DNA via the RFC complex.
In this case Rad17 replaces the largest subunit (subunit 1) in the RFC complex to form
Rad17–RFC2–5. Rad17 is essential during mammalian development since its inactivation
in the mouse is embryonically lethal260. However, it is possible that this is not because of
its participation in sensing DNA damage, but a consequence of its role in the repair of
damage by HR.At this stage the action of the 9–1–1 complex is still speculative,but it may
work alongside ATM and ATR, which are independently recruited to the sites of DNA
damage. ATM and ATR have been implicated in the efﬁcient loading of the 9–1–1 com-
plex through phosphorylation of the Rad17–RFC clamp loader. RPA-coated single-
stranded DNA enhances Rad17 binding, resulting in the recruitment of 9–1–1 to these
sites, similar to the ATRIP, which is also targeted to single-stranded DNA in an RPA-
dependent manner. Like ATM, there is evidence that 9–1–1 is directly involved in DNA
repair261.In this respect,it is possible that the 9–1–1 complex serves as a general recruiting
platform for DNA-damage checkpoint proteins as well as for DNA-repair enzymes.
4.2.4 POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE-1
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme that can be
activated by ionizing radiation, alkylating agents, or oxidative stress. Like DNA-PKCS, it
recognizes distortions in the DNA helical backbone; ﬁrst of all DNA strand breaks, but
also other structures, such as single-strand regions, four-way (Holliday) junctions, and
DNA hairpins. Such binding, through its double zinc-ﬁnger DNA-binding domain, leads
to PARP’s catalytic activation and the display of the function ﬁrst described by Pierre
Chambon (Strasbourg, France) and co-workers in 1963; that is, the posttranslational
modiﬁcation called poly(ADP-ribose) polymerization262. This is the most extensive post-
translational modiﬁcation known. The process consumes NAD, not unlike the (NAD)-
dependent HDAC Sir2, discussed in Chapter 2. The enzyme targets glutamate or
aspartate residues in a number of proteins, including PARP-1 itself, histones, and topoi-
somerases. It is possible that PARP’s action facilitates access of DNA-repair enzymes to
the site of damage,for example,by the covalent modiﬁcation of histones or interaction of
histones with auto-modiﬁed PARP.Whereas PARP-1 accounts for most of the total cellu-
lar poly(ADP-ribose) formation, other PARPs exist, including PARP-2, which can also be
activated by DNA strand breaks.Interestingly,whereas mice with either PARP-1 or PARP-
2 deleted from their genome are viable and fertile,the combined ablation of these genes is
embryonically lethal.
Upon activation, PARP-1 can signal cell death, probably after severe genotoxic stress,
through the depletion of cellular NAD pools. Normally, at low levels of DNA damage,
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerization is a transient modiﬁcation, which is rapidly reversed
by the action of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). In this context, PARP-1 is a
GENOME MAINTENANCE
101

survival factor that has been implicated in multiple DNA-repair pathways, including
base-excision repair (BER; see below), and also DSB repair. PARP-1, PARP-2, and two
other PARPs,TANK1 and TANK2 (called tankyrases),also play a role in telomere mainte-
nance (see below).As yet the mechanistic details of PARP-1’s involvement in DNA-repair
pathways are unclear, but modiﬁcation of chromatin structure to provide accessibility to
DNA-repair proteins could be important.Results thus far indicate that PARP-1 can facili-
tate both the compaction and decondensation of chromatin through poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerization with histone and non-histone chromosomal proteins or itself as the
targets, depending on the signals available.
PARP-1 is one of several genome-maintenance factors that have been linked to aging.
The activity of PARP was tested in white blood cells of different mammalian species
stimulated with either 
 radiation or double-stranded oligonucleotides and was found to
correlate with the lifespan of the species263,264. Although correlations can be misleading
and nothing is known about PARP activity in different organs and tissues, this may point
to a genuine relationship between genome-maintenance capacity and species lifespan.
4.2.5 REPLICATION AND TRANSCRIPTION AS 
DNA-DAMAGE SENSORS
As we have seen, the sensing of DNA damage has been studied most extensively in prolif-
erating cells, in which it is strongly associated with DNA-damage checkpoints and DNA
repair. Replication is of course an ideal way of sensing DNA damage, since its machinery
removes the histone protein cover from the DNA and cannot proceed immediately when
it encounters DNA damage. Outside the S-phase, other ways of DNA-damage sensing
must come into play. Another form of DNA processing that lends itself well to monitor-
ing DNA integrity and to activating DNA-damage signaling, also in non-replicating cells,
is transcription265. Of the three RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II covers the largest
and possibly the most relevant part of the genome; that is, transcribed protein-coding
genes. DNA lesions blocking the elongation of RNA polymerase II can signal apoptosis
through p53 or independent of p53266. As further described below, the process of tran-
scription-coupled repair can prevent this situation by quickly removing the lesions
blocking the polymerase.
4.2.6 DNA-MISMATCH REPAIR AS A DAMAGE SENSOR
DNA-mismatch repair (MMR) is principally an enzymatic pathway for editing newly
replicated DNA (see below). However, apart from correcting nucleotide mismatches
as a result of replication errors, MMR also recognizes DNA lesions, most notably 
102
GENOME MAINTENANCE

O6-methylguanine, the major lesion produced by methylating agents. Cells with a defect
in the process that normally repairs such lesions undergo programmed cell death (apop-
tosis), but only in the presence of an active MMR system. When such cells are also defec-
tive for MMR they are highly resistant to killing by methylating agents. This has been
explained by MMR signaling of apoptosis. In addition to apoptosis, treatment of mam-
malian cells with methylating agents induces cell-cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, which
also is dependent on a functional MMR system. This is accompanied by the activation of
ATM and ATR267. The idea is that the MMR proteins MSH2 and MSH6 would recognize
the damage and directly transmit the signal to the checkpoint machinery.
At this point it is not clear if the MMR-dependent apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest repre-
sent genuine DNA-damage checkpoint responses or are merely by-products of MMR’s
attempt to process adducts resembling true mismatches. If the repair pathways that nor-
mally repair DNA methylation damage are inactive,the MMR proteins MSH2 and MSH6
may recognize this damage and confuse it with a mismatch. Since MMR can only excise
bases from the newly synthesized strand, the lesion will remain. This will result in
repeated cycles of futile repair, which will keep the methylated, template strand single-
stranded for much of the time and may lead to a DSB.This may then provide the ultimate
signal for apoptosis268. However, alternative models in which the MMR proteins act as
direct sensors capable of signaling to the apoptotic machinery have been proposed269.
Hence, it is as yet unclear whether MMR is a DNA-damage sensor or if the observed
signaling merely reﬂects its structural limitations in damage processing.
4.2.7 ROLE OF CHROMATIN STRUCTURE IN 
SENSING DNA DAMAGE
An efﬁcient cellular response to DNA damage requires changes in higher-order genome
structure—through nucleosome rearrangements or chromatin remodeling, as it is also
called. The signals eliciting responses to DNA damage are not necessarily a detection of
the primary damage but could be a response to modiﬁed chromatin structure. Similar to
other nuclear processes, such as the establishment of heterochromatin or transcription,
chromatin remodeling in the DNA-damage response is accomplished through modiﬁca-
tions of histone proteins. These marks include phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups and
even small proteins, such as ubiquitin or SUMO, a small, ubiquitin-related modiﬁer. One
of the best-characterized chromatin modiﬁcation events in DNA-damage responses is
phosphorylation of the SQ motif found in histone H2A or the H2AX histone variant
in higher eukaryotes270. This modiﬁcation is an early response to the induction of DNA
damage, and occurs in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, suggesting an impor-
tant conserved function. This phosphorylation can be carried out by ATM, ATR, or 
DNA-PKCS in a redundant, overlapping manner.
GENOME MAINTENANCE
103

H2AX activation is important for the repair of DSBs,or of SSBs converted into DSBs by
replication. The key role of H2AX in genome maintenance is underscored by increased
tumor susceptibility, genomic instability, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation in H2AX-
haploinsufﬁcient mice271. Foci of phosphorylated H2AX (designated 
H2AX) are readily
formed at the site of DNA DSBs. Indeed, the formation and loss of 
H2AX has proved a
sensitive measure for DSB formation and repair. Interestingly, 
H2AX foci have been
found to accumulate in senescing human cell cultures and in aging mice272, contributing
to the now widely held belief that cellular senescence is a DNA damage response. 
H2AX
may exert its function as a genome-maintenance factor through chromatin remodeling.
H2AX phosphorylation in mammalian cells spreads into genome regions of millions of
base pairs ﬂanking a break. This inﬂuences higher-order chromatin structure and may
make the DNA more accessible to DNA-repair enzymes.
4.2.8 SUMMARY
In summary, there are different overlapping signaling mechanisms for DNA damage.
Their utilization depends on the type of damage, the phase of the cell cycle and, to some
extent, the species. DNA-damage signaling appears to be well integrated in the actual
repair processes, with some sensors or transducers being actual components of a repair
pathway. Sensors may work on the basis of alterations in DNA higher-order structure,
which are also part of the response to DNA damage and tightly coordinated with DNA
repair to facilitate access to the lesion and subsequent restoration of chromatin structure
after repair is complete. The proteins that sense or detect DNA damage may be shared
between pathways that signal damage to enact cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or replicative
senescence and those that repair the damage.There may be a branch point,with the num-
ber of lesions as the main determinant of the option that is chosen.However,it is also pos-
sible that there is a distinction between DNA-damage sensors that signal repair and those
that signal to enact a cellular DNA-damage response. Also in this case, the level of DNA
damage could determine the choice between these two branches of the DNA-damage
response. At low levels of DNA damage, signaling proteins may not be quick enough to
reach the damage before it is repaired.At high levels of damage the repair systems may be
saturated and signaling proteins, such as ATR, may then be able to reach the damage and
signal cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or cellular senescence273. These options are not mutu-
ally exclusive and DNA-damage checkpoint proteins, as we have seen, can get involved in
DNA repair.It is possible that cells rarely suffer from such high levels of DNA damage that
an apoptotic or senescence response is necessary and that most of the time DNA-repair
systems are capable of handling the situation.This may be especially true for non-dividing
cells,which probably rarely need—if ever—to take action as abruptly as cells in the middle
of DNA replication.

4.3 DNA-repair mechanisms
Before discussing the different mechanisms for repairing damage inﬂicted on the
genome from various endogenous and exogenous sources, it is ﬁrst necessary to con-
template the options of not repairing damage at all, which is in a sense the simplest
solution, especially when there is reason to assume that the damage is likely not to have
major adverse consequences. Such cases exist and some of them are, somewhat para-
doxically, a part of the normal DNA-damage response. They will be discussed here
under the heading of DNA-repair mechanisms. Then it is important to consider the
next easiest form of DNA repair, which is known as direct reversal of DNA damage. The
fact that there are only very few types of damage that can be repaired through such
mechanisms already suggests that the problem is very complex and that such direct
solutions may work for some major lesions, but do not reﬂect in any way the more gen-
eral strategies in genome maintenance that have evolved. Indeed, most DNA damage is
repaired through excision-repair pathways. The double-helical structure of DNA lends
itself well to such mechanisms because of its two complementary strands. When one
strand is damaged the other one can serve as the template for restoring the original sit-
uation. This offers yet another advantage of using double-stranded DNA as the carrier
of the genetic information rather than single-stranded RNA or DNA and may explain
why virtually all species use the DNA double helix for this purpose.Also, the DNA bases
are ideally suited for repair. They cannot be easily converted, for example, by sponta-
neous alkylation or deamination into other natural bases. This may explain why DNA
uses thymine rather than uracil as in RNA. Indeed, the repair system would be unable to
distinguish a deaminated cytosine from a uracil. Such uracils are now effectively
removed by uracil DNA glycosylase. One exception involves methylated CpG sites.
5-Methylcytosine can spontaneously deaminate into thymine, resulting in a mismatch
with guanine. This explains why so many spontaneous mutations are found at such
sites274. They also accumulate with age in different organs and tissues of the mouse275
(see also Chapter 6).
The presence of two complementary strands is especially useful for excision-repair
systems,which work by cutting part of the damaged strand containing the lesion out of the
DNA and subsequently pasting a replacement fragment using the non-damaged strand as
the template.However,there are multiple overlapping DNA-repair systems,some of which
are also capable of repairing lesions opposite each other at one site on each strand, for
example,DSBs or DNA interstrand cross-links.Such lesions may be less frequent,but they
are also highly toxic and present a considerable problem to the cell’s arsenal of repair tools.
As discussed above, possibly all these systems interact with DNA-damage checkpoints and
chromatin-remodeling systems. Figure 4.4 schematically depicts the major DNA-repair
pathways in mammalian cells.

4.3.1 TOLERANCE OF DNA DAMAGE
Upon sensing DNA damage, the easiest response for the cell is to do nothing and either
tolerate the damage or, when in the process of transcription or replication, activate systems
allowing it to bypass the lesion.The ﬁrst option may be selected by terminally differentiated
cells in mammalian organisms, such as neurons. Nouspikel and Hanawalt observed that
neurons do not efﬁciently remove DNA damage from their genome276. In general, DNA
repair appears to be less active in terminally differentiated cells than in proliferating,undif-
ferentiated cells. For example, in my own laboratory, we showed in 1986 that senescence
of rat skin ﬁbroblasts in culture (reminiscent of terminal differentiation) is associated with
an approximately 50% reduction in excision-repair-associated DNA synthesis277.
Interestingly,as subsequently demonstrated in Hanawalt’s laboratory for UV-irradiated
human neurons, whereas the bulk of their genome is not repaired, lesions from active
genes were removed swiftly. In these cells they also observed proﬁcient repair of lesions
caused by UV irradiation in the non-transcribed, opposite strand, which is unusual (see
below). They called this type of repair DAR, or differentiation-associated repair, and
hypothesized that in this way neurons maintain a clean template for repairing their active
genes while ignoring the remaining part of their genome. While still speculative, this
strategy may be yet another example of a sound allocation of resources by the organism.
Indeed, genome alterations in these cells may only start having adverse effects well after
the reproductive period,in which case it is only prudent not to invest any major resources
in repairing non-essential parts of the genome in such cells.

Ignoring lesions also occurs in proliferating cells, both of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
origin, during replication. This is called translesion DNA synthesis, a process to avoid
cell death when encountering unrepaired DNA damage. For example, the major muta-
genic oxidative DNA lesion, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG; a modiﬁcation of the C8
position of guanine with its tautomeric form called 8-hydroxyguanine), is bypassed efﬁ-
ciently by high-ﬁdelity DNA polymerases. However, this frequently results in the incor-
poration of an adenine rather than a cytosine opposite the damaged G278. This A–8-oxoG
mismatch is often not recognized by the mismatch-repair systems that normally proofread
DNA,resulting in G →T transversion mutations,frequently observed in human cancers.
Lesion bypass,however,can also be regulated by utilizing speciﬁc enzymes dedicated to
operate with high ﬁdelity on DNA harboring speciﬁc types of DNA damage.For example,
the Rev1 protein incorporates cytosines opposite abasic sites, allowing lesion bypass in
both yeast and mammalian cells. In humans, pold, encoded by the XPV gene, is able to
insert the correct adenine base across a cyclobutane thymidine dimer, the main UV-
induced lesion. When encountering replication-blocking lesions, the use of such
enzymes, often referred to as Y-family polymerases279, increases the chance of survival
while maintaining a reasonable level of genome integrity. This is illustrated by the
increased mutagenesis and reduced survival of cells from patients with human xero-
derma pigmentosum (XP) harboring a genetic defect in the XPV gene280.
The mechanism of translesion synthesis is not as straightforward as one might expect.
Replication of the lagging strand is discontinuous and a lesion will not compromise repli-
cation-fork progression. However, if a replication block is located in the leading-strand
template, the polymerases can become uncoupled and continued template unwinding
allows nascent lagging-strand synthesis to proceed past the blocked nascent leading
strand (see Chapter 3).A possible scenario for translesion synthesis in bacteria,derived in
part from reconstitution experiments in vitro281,is as follows (R.Fuchs,personal commu-
nication). The lesion is bypassed to reinitiate leading-strand synthesis downstream of the
lesion, which leaves a gap. Such a gap, which can be 1000 nucleotides long, can then be
ﬁlled by the specialized Y polymerases in an error-prone manner. However, an alternative
way of gap ﬁlling was already described by Rupp and Howard-Flanders in UV-irradiated
bacteria lacking nucleotide-excision repair (NER)282. Such so-called postreplication
repair involves template switching—using the newly synthesized complementary strand
as a template rather than the damaged one—and recombinational gap ﬁlling283. This lat-
ter,recombinational strategy is a genuine mode of DNA repair,most notably in the repair
of DSBs,and will be discussed further below.In yeast,the lesion-bypass pathway is part of
the RAD6 pathway, which contributes to this organism’s resistance to DNA damage. This
class of mechanisms for tolerance to DNA damage should not be confused with another
form of postreplication repair, MMR, which will be discussed below.
The story of the Y-family polymerases, the so-called mutator polymerases, really
begins with the discovery of SOS repair in bacteria. In the SOS response about 30 genes
GENOME MAINTENANCE
107

are coordinately induced as a consequence of the proteolytic inactivation of LexA, which
is greatly enhanced by the RecA protein bound to single-stranded DNA. The latter
explains how the SOS response is induced by DNA-damaging agents. However, LexA can
also be inactivated or its cellular concentration decreased under stressful conditions,such
as starvation and bacterial senescence (elicited by starvation-induced arrest of prolifera-
tion). SOS induction and mutagenesis have been observed in aging E. coli colonies, in the
absence of exogenous sources of DNA damage284. The rationale for such a survival strat-
egy of unicellular organisms under adverse conditions has been discussed in Chapter 2:
a transient increase in mutation rate provides some members of the population with a
new genotype that allows them to survive and proliferate. Such adaptive mutagenesis
can even take the appearance of being directed to speciﬁc genes. This phenomenon was
ﬁrst noted by John Cairns and Patricia Foster (then both in Boston, MA, USA) as a high
frequency of mutations reversing a mutationally inactivated lacZ gene in stationary
cultures of E. coli285. LacZ encodes the enzyme 
-galactosidase, permitting the use of
lactose as a nutrient. The mutations in these stationary cultures appeared to be directed
by the selection process, since they only occur after these cells had been exposed to lac-
tose. Rather than indicating some hidden causality, however, these mutants are singled
out since only they, and no others, allow the cell to resume growth.
It is important to realize that a similar strategy in multicellular organisms is not very
useful. Whereas there may be evolutionary advantages for all species in increasing the
amount of genetic variation in the germ line (temporarily, because the ﬁtness of such
mutators rapidly declines as a consequence of Muller’s ratchet; see Chapter 2), random
mutations in somatic cells offer no selective advantage, but contribute to disease and
aging, the topic of this book. An exception is the highly regulated process of somatic
hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes,which is critical for unfolding the full power of
the immune response. In this form of adaptive mutagenesis mutations are targeted to the
variable regions of rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) genes to generate a wide variety of
memory cells with high afﬁnity for a speciﬁc antigen. The enzyme activation-induced
cytosine deaminase (AID) plays a major role in this process by deaminating cytosines in
Ig genes, leading to the formation of uracil. It is likely that the subsequent mutations are
then caused by Y-family DNA polymerases that bypass these lesions286. There is evidence
that the same enzyme also deaminates mRNA in a process called editing. RNA editing is
the co- or posttranscriptional modiﬁcation of the primary sequence of RNA through
nucleotide deletion, insertion, or base-modiﬁcation mechanisms. In mammals editing
seems to exclusively use base modiﬁcation. RNA-editing processes are known to create
diversity in proteins involved in various pathways like lipid transport and metabolism287.
For example, deamination of cytosine generates a shorter form of the apolipoprotein-B
mRNA in mammalian intestine and liver.
The genes encoding the Y-family polymerases induced by the SOS response in 
bacteria—pol IV and pol V—led to the discovery, by searching genome databases, of
multiple orthologs and paralogs in eukaryotes, including mammals. All these DNA
108
GENOME MAINTENANCE

polymerases display increased error rates on undamaged DNA (as compared to replicative
polymerases) and are capable of translesion synthesis of damaged DNA.In contrast to the
situation in bacteria, these enzymes are constitutively present in mammalian cells and
tissues and highly regulated to avoid their access to undamaged DNA280.
The mechanisms to ignore DNA damage or bypass lesions at the risk of mutation are
highly relevant for late-life genomic integrity. Ignoring DNA damage in postmitotic cells
leads to an increased DNA damage load at old age,which may contribute to cellular degen-
eration and death. Likewise, mutations as a consequence of lesion bypass will accumulate
with age and can easily lead to increased risk of cancer and other adverse effects. This will
be further discussed in Chapter 6. However, DNA-damage tolerance can also have imme-
diate consequences for the cell at the level of gene transcription. Indeed, translesion syn-
thesis not only occurs during replication, but also during transcription, which has been
observed in both bacteria and mammalian cells, and shown to lead to mutant transcripts
(transcriptional mutagenesis)288. Since quiescent, non-replicating cells are the norm in
tissues of multicellular organisms, this was an important discovery, the consequences of
which are still not entirely clear. Indeed, whereas replication errors in certain genes can
conceivably lead to cancer, a clonal disease, the effect of transcriptional errors may be
transient and have a limited impact on an organism. Nevertheless, it is easy to see that
whereas the effects of infrequent events, such as occasional misincorporation of amino
acids or ribonucleotides, are likely to be limited, consistent bypassing of a persistent lesion
in a gene could alter the entire transcriptional output of that gene in a given cell.
Most studies on transcriptional bypass have been done in bacteria. The results indicate
that one of the most frequent base changes—deaminated cytosine or uracil—is readily
bypassed by E. coli RNA polymerase,resulting in mutated transcript.Fortunately,uracil is
normally rapidly removed by BER, which is also the case in mammalian cells (see further
below).In mammals,altered proteins as a result of transcriptional mutagenesis have been
demonstrated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and aged control individ-
uals without dementia, but not in the brains of young control subjects289. This increase in
altered protein with age may remind the reader of Leslie Orgel’s error catastrophe
hypothesis (Chapter 1), which was discarded years ago, mainly because of a lack of evi-
dence for a high frequency of altered proteins with age. To implicate transcriptional
mutagenesis as a causal factor in aging it would be important to study transcriptional
inﬁdelity in the synthesis of components of the transcriptional machinery itself, which
would create the positive-feedback loop originally suggested by Orgel290.
4.3.2 DIRECT REVERSAL
Apart from ignoring it altogether,the next simplest way of dealing with DNA damage is its
direct reversal. The main reason why this is not utilized more generally is that it involves
the need for too many specialized enzymes, which is genetically costly when dealing with
GENOME MAINTENANCE
109

hundreds and perhaps thousands of different types of chemical damage in DNA.
Nevertheless, three major systems of direct reversal exist: enzymatic photoreactivation of
UV-induced pyrimidine dimers,reversal of alkylation damage,and ligation of DNA SSBs.
In photoreactivation,the nature of which was ﬁrst described by Jane and Dick Setlow291,
a single enzyme, photolyase, is able to repair UV-induced DNA lesions—cyclobutane
pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) or pyrimidine 6–4 pyrimidone photoproducts (6–4PPs)—by
effectively reversing their formation using blue light292.Based on what has been mentioned
at the beginning of this chapter regarding UV radiation as perhaps the main source of
DNA damage early in the history of life, it is not surprising that such a highly speciﬁc
mechanism as enzymatic photoreactivation for the speedy direct repair of the main 
UV-induced lesions has evolved.The system also occurs in yeast,but most likely not in pla-
cental mammals, which may have lost it during evolution. It is possible that the need for
such a specialized mechanism has become much less in multicellular organisms, in which
only a fraction of the cells—and then not even in all organisms—is regularly exposed to
UV. In mammalian cells UV damage is generally repaired through the NER pathway (see
below), which in humans is especially important for protecting the skin. Interestingly,
transgenic mice have been generated expressing marsupial CPD-photolyase, which dra-
matically reduced acute UV effects like erythema (sunburn),hyperplasia,and apoptosis293.
The direct reversal of alkylation damage in human cells can be carried out by three
proteins.The O6-alkylguanine alkyl transferase (encoded by the MGMT gene in humans)
catalyses the transfer of alkyl groups, varying from methyl to benzyl, from the O6 of gua-
nine to one of the repair enzyme’s own cysteine groups. This protein is itself expended in
the reaction.Less widespread direct repair enzymes in mammals are the ABH2 and ABH3
proteins. Orthologs of E. coli AlkB, these demethylases catalyze the oxidation and release
of the methyl group from 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine. Interestingly, ABH3
can also repair RNA294, which is in fact the main target for these lesions.
O6-Alkylguanines are lesions of considerable biological importance in mammals.They
are highly mutagenic and may occur spontaneously at a high rate,possibly through intra-
cellular methyl donors, such as S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Mice lacking MGMT are
highly susceptible to tumorigenesis by alkylating agents295. Interestingly, transgenic
C3HeB male mice overexpressing the human MGMT gene in liver and brain were found
to have signiﬁcantly lower levels of hepatocellular carcinoma, a frequent spontaneous
tumor in this mouse strain296. This indicates that O6-alkylguanines occur spontaneously
and contribute signiﬁcantly to the risk of liver cancer in animals of this strain.
E. coli and other prokaryotes are able to rapidly increase the amount of their O6-
methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (O6-MGT I) activity upon chronic exposure to
alkylation stress297. Discovered by Leona Samson (Cambridge, MA, USA) in the labora-
tory of John Cairns, then in Boston, MA, USA, this response is called the adaptive
response, which can lead from the 1–2 molecules of the protein that are normally present
to several thousands of such molecules in adapted cells. There is no evidence for such a
110
GENOME MAINTENANCE

response by the mammalian MGMT gene, which in this respect resembles the E. coli
O6-MGT II gene, which is also not inducible (at least, not in an O6-MGT I mutant).
DNA SSBs can be repaired through direct reversal, simply by rejoining the ends using
ligase I. However, SSBs, for example, as inﬂicted by ionizing radiation or ROS, possess
abnormal 3' and 5' termini, which need to be restored to proper 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phos-
phate moieties. Therefore, most SSBs are repaired through the BER process (see below).
4.3.3 DNA-EXCISION REPAIR
There are three excision-repair pathways: BER, NER, and MMR. They all employ the
double-helical nature of the DNA to remove lesions from one strand and restore the orig-
inal situation using the second strand as a template (Fig. 4.5).

Fig. 4.5 Simpliﬁed version of the three excision-repair pathways: base-excision repair (BER),
nucleotide-excision repair (NER), and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). They all repair DNA damage
through excision and resynthesis using the opposite strand as a template. AP, abasic (see text for
an explanation).

4.3.3.1 Base excision repair (BER)
BER is speciﬁcally devoted to the repair of small base damage, SSBs, and abasic sites, as a
consequence of such processes as oxidation and non-enzymatic hydrolysis of base–sugar
bonds. These lesions occur at high frequency; there are tens of thousands of lesions per
day in a typical cell. Spontaneous base damage can occur, for example, as a consequence
of hydrolytic deamination of cytosine, resulting in uracil. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
can cause a large number of different types of small base damage, including the 8-oxoG
lesion mentioned above and thymine glycol298. To repair the large variety of small base
alterations, BER relies on a battery of enzymes, termed glycosylases, that can recognize a
speciﬁc type of damaged base and cleave the N-glycosylic bond between the base and the
sugar. There are glycosylases speciﬁc for deaminated bases, alkylated bases, oxidized
bases, and base mismatches. Examples are uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG), recognizing
deaminated cytosine (uracil), and TDG and MBD4 DNA glycosylases, excising thymine
when it is mispaired with guanine as a consequence of deamination of 5-methylcytosine.
There are many others, partially overlapping in their activities and also including a
number of enzymes that recognize oxidative lesions, such as OGG1 DNA glycosylase
excising 8-oxoG from DNA (its ortholog in bacteria is Fpg),and NTH,removing oxidized
pyrimidines. When occurring in transcribed sequences, oxidative base damage can also
be repaired by transcription-coupled repair (see below). The repair of endogenous DNA
base damage was reviewed extensively by Barnes and Lindahl in 2004298.
Removal of damaged bases by hydrolytic glycosylases leaves abasic sites, or AP sites,
which can also be a direct product of damage. Once initiated, BER can proceed along two
mechanistically different lines: short- or long-patch BER.The distinction involves the size
of the repair patch,the number of nucleotides replaced.For short-patch BER,which is the
major pathway,this is only a single nucleotide.Long-patch BER involves between two and
10 nucleotides. The enzyme that recognizes and cleaves the 5' phosphodiester bond at AP
sites is AP endonuclease (APE1),the key component of BER after the glycosylase has done
its work.There is another enzyme that can cleave at the AP site,this time at its 3 site.This
enzyme,designated AP lyase,is associated with some glycosylases as well as with the main
polymerase involved in BER, pol
. The exact mechanistic details as to how the cell
decides which activity and which branch of the BER pathway to use for which lesion, is
not yet entirely clear and a discussion is beyond the scope of this book. The reader is
referred to several excellent recent reviews283,298,299.
Brieﬂy, in the short-patch pathway pol
 is recruited to ﬁll the one-nucleotide gap.
Ligation occurs through the Lig3–XRCC1 complex. In the less utilized long-patch 
sub-pathway, the replicative DNA polymerases pol / or pol
, in a complex with
RFC/PCNA,displace the strand,generating a ﬂap of between two and 10 nucleotides,which
is subsequently cut off by FEN1 endonuclease. The nick is closed by ligase I. As already
mentioned, SSBs, such as those induced by ionizing radiation or ROS, are also repaired
through the BER pathway. For this purpose, the enzyme polynucleotide kinase (PNK) or
112
GENOME MAINTENANCE

APE1, in a complex with XRCC1, converts the damaged termini into 5'-phosphate and 
3'-hydroxyl moieties300.
Apart from the core players, accessory factors likely play a role in BER. As mentioned
above,the ring-like PCNA DNA clamp in combination with the RFC clamp loader organ-
izes various proteins involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, DNA modiﬁcation, and
chromatin remodeling. As such, it stimulates FEN1 cleavage of the ﬂap in long-patch
BER. A similar role can be played by the DNA-damage sensor complex 9–1–1, which is
structurally and functionally similar to PCNA (see above). As already mentioned, mem-
bers of the PARP family may be involved in BER by binding to SSBs, either those arising
during BER or breaks that are induced by ROS or ionizing radiation. PARP is then auto-
modiﬁed, as described above. Since BER proceeds efﬁciently in extracts of Parp-1-null
cells, such a role is not essential. In this respect it has been postulated that PARP is merely
facilitating access to the DNA through local chromatin relaxation.
As it turned out,BER is not only important in the maintenance of the nuclear genome,but
also highly proﬁcient in the repair of small base damage in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)301.
This is not surprising since mitochondria are the main sites of ROS production,and ROS in
turn cause the lesions that are the main substrate for BER, as we have seen. Only the short-
patch variant of BER appears to be active in repairing lesions in mtDNA.As discussed further
below there is some evidence that this activity declines with age in rodents.
BER must be a critically important genome-maintenance system,since complete absence
of one of its core components is incompatible with life. For example, the homozygous
deletion of APE1, XRCC1, ligase I, or pol
 in the mouse germ line is embryonically lethal.
Indeed,in contrast to other repair systems,there are no known human diseases caused by a
complete defect in BER, although it remains possible that slight deﬁciencies are associated
with disease or accelerated aging. On the other hand, elimination of one of its glycosylase
functions has only a limited impact.For example,mice with an engineered defect in uracil-
DNA glycosylase have an increased level of uracil in their genome, but do not exhibit a
greatly increased frequency of spontaneous mutation. They also do not display any signs
of premature aging. This lack of a major phenotype may be due to the existence of a com-
pensatory uracil-DNA glycosylase activity in the form of SMUG uracil-DNA glycosylase298.
Targeted inactivation of the OGG1 DNA glycosylase in the mouse led to the accu-
mulation of 8-oxoG and a modest increase in spontaneous mutation frequency in 
non-proliferative tissues, but no increased spontaneous tumors or other marked patho-
logical changes302. The lifespan of these animals was not signiﬁcantly shorter and there
were no signs of premature aging. The nature of a possible backup activity for this
enzyme is not known, but transcription-coupled repair or NER may contribute.
The results with these and other mouse glycosylase mutants suggest that there is signif-
icant overlap between glycosylases in recognizing different lesions as well as overlap with
other repair pathways. This overlap may to some extent compensate for the inherent
inefﬁciency of BER in needing so many different glycosylases to accommodate the
GENOME MAINTENANCE
113

wide range of DNA lesions in a cell. A battery of different enzymes may be unavoidable
because it may simply not be possible to design a general recognition system for all pos-
sible types of small base damage, which is in striking contrast to the next system to be
discussed, NER.
4.3.3.2 Nucleotide excision repair (NER)
NER, a general repair system that removes damaged DNA bases by dual incision of the
affected strand followed by resynthesis of 24–32 bp (in eukaryotes), is inextricably linked
to the heritable human disease xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP patients develop fatal
skin cancers when exposed to sunlight and in 1967 it occurred to James Cleaver (San
Francisco, CA, USA), then a postdoctoral fellow at the laboratory of Bob Painter at the
University of California at San Francisco, that the high susceptibility to cancer in these
patients could be related to failure of DNA repair of sunlight-induced DNA lesions303. At
the time,DNA repair had just been discovered,in bacteria (see the beginning of this chap-
ter), and the ﬁrst methods to measure the repair of UV-induced damage had been devel-
oped.Pettijohn and Hanawalt were the ﬁrst to describe the patching step in the process by
showing after irradiation that bromouracil incorporation occurred in small patches and
did not give the density shifts expected from semiconservative DNA replication (see the
description of the Meselson and Stahl experiment in Chapter 1). They called this repair
replication304. Painter himself had developed the techniques of autoradiographic and
equilibrium density-gradient detection of repair (unscheduled DNA synthesis and repair
replication)305.Unscheduled DNA synthesis is a dramatically visual method of measuring
NER, which has a far larger patch size than BER (Fig. 4.6). Using these methods Cleaver
found that XP cells were indeed repair-deﬁcient306.
The next key player in this ﬁeld was Dirk Bootsma of the Erasmus University in
Rotterdam,the Netherlands,who fused cells from different XP patients,to see if they were
able to complement each other by restoring UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in
the heterodikaryons. If so, then the genetic defect in DNA repair in each of the two
complementing cells was in different genetic complementation groups required for exci-
sion repair307. Soon, this kind of somatic-cell genetic analysis using cells of XP patients
from different families indicated multiple genetic complementation groups for XP,which
were designated XPA–XPG. These observations, in turn, suggested that multiple genes
are required for the particular mode of excision repair demonstrated in normal human
cells and that mutational inactivation of any one of these genes results in XP.
NER is essentially different from BER in the sense that it has no battery of enzymes to
recognize speciﬁc chemical groups that make up the lesion, but instead recognizes major
backbone distortions of the DNA. Such bulky lesions include the aforementioned 
UV-induced lesions, especially 6–4PPs, and damage created by electrophilic metabolites
of carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons, formed during inefﬁcient combustion of fossil
114

fuels and found in cigarette smoke, car exhaust fumes, and barbecued meat. The best
known example is benzo(a)pyrene, which has been studied extensively as a genotoxic
agent (Chapter 6).
NER has two sub-pathways, differing in damage recognition but sharing the same
downstream repair machinery: global genome NER (GG-NER) for the removal of distort-
ing lesions anywhere in the genome and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) for the
elimination of distorting DNA damage blocking transcription.As already brieﬂy discussed
above, in TC-NER lesions are sensed by RNA polymerase II itself and the resulting signals
can activate either repair or apoptosis.As the name suggests,TC-NER involves the removal
of lesions from the transcribed strand in active genes, which for some lesions, such as
CPDs, is much faster than GG-NER. The pathway was discovered by Vilhelm Bohr
(Baltimore, MD, USA), then in the laboratory of Philip Hanawalt (Stanford, CA, USA)308.
Interestingly, it is now clear that TC-NER also functions in removing non-NER lesions.
Whereas GG-NER can also remove some types of oxidative lesion, TC-NER acts on those
oxidative lesions thought to be the exclusive domain of BER309.Whereas this is controversial

incorporation of [3H]thymidine is visualized by autoradiography. The occasional S-phase cell is

incorporation, revealed by the black grains above the nuclei, indicate excision repair of the 
UV-induced lesions.

in view of the recent retraction of several major publications310, it remains a likely
possibility. In this sense, TC-NER is now to some extent recognized as a repair pathway in
its own right and often just referred to as transcription-coupled repair.
In TC-NER, DNA-damage sensing occurs by RNA polymerase II, thereby arresting
transcription. Transcription arrest is followed by the recruitment of the products of the
CSA and CSB genes,with the CSB gene product possibly acting in a complex with the basal
transcription factor IIH TFIIH, and perhaps the XPG protein. TFIIH, also needed for
transcription initiation (see Chapter 3), has then already dissociated and needs to be
recruited again. Its XPB and XPD helicase protein subunits are again needed to open up
the helix, in this case a 24–32-nucleotide stretch containing the damaged region. The
details of the early steps in TC-NER are not yet known, but the CSA and CSB proteins are
thought to be involved in displacing RNA polymerase stalled by a DNA lesion and recruit-
ing the NER (and perhaps BER) machinery to the site of the lesion. The CSB protein is
a member of the SWI/SNF family of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors (see
Chapter 3) and changing DNA higher-order structure may be an important component
of its role in TC-NER. In addition, various subunits of TFIIH and also the XPG nuclease
may assist in the removal of the RNA polymerase and RNA.At this point TC-NER merges
with GG-NER.
Of note, heritable mutations in CSA or CSB cause Cockayne syndrome, an autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by progressive postnatal growth failure, neurological
dysfunction, and a short lifespan of about 12 years on average. This disease, which shows
no signs of increased cancer, is often considered as a segmental progeroid syndrome and
will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. It is only one of several human disorders
associated with NER genetic defects, underscoring the importance of the pathway for
human health, but also pointing towards a certain tolerance for its absence, which is in
striking contrast with BER.
In GG-NER the situation with respect to DNA-damage sensing is far more complex
than for TC-NER.As we have seen,TC-NER is able to quickly recognize lesions,including
those that are normally a substrate for BER, on the basis of transcription arrest. In this
respect, TC-NER functions, to some extent, as a backup system for BER, by acting on 
non-bulky lesions,such as oxidized or methylated bases.However,certain helix-distorting
oxidative lesions,such as cyclopurines,fall within the realm of GG-NER.It has been spec-
ulated that accumulation of these lesions in the brain may explain the observed progres-
sive atrophy of the cerebral cortex of XP patients311.
Because its recognition system is based on distortions of the DNA double helix, GG-
NER may also occasionally attack natural conﬁgurations of undamaged DNA, evidence
for which has indeed been obtained using cell-free extracts acting on synthetic DNA frag-
ments312. These ﬁndings suggest that even in non-dividing cells there can be considerable
DNA turnover due to this kind of gratuitous repair, which may then contribute to muta-
tion accumulation during aging, due to errors during resynthesis. However, this is merely
116
GENOME MAINTENANCE

speculation because GG-NER is likely to abort when no lesion is present, based on the
damage-veriﬁcation role of XPA (see below).
A key role in lesion recognition in GG-NER in the context of chromatin organization
is probably played by the damaged-DNA-binding protein (DDB), at least in the case of
UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. This protein may activate the DNA-damage checkpoint
protein ATR and also initiates GG-NER, by bending the DNA to the lesion, so as to allow
XPC to bind to it. The important role of DDB in NER in a situation in vivo is indicated by
the fact that a heritable mutation in the gene XPE, encoding its small, p48 subunit
(DDB2), can cause XP. The gene encoding p48 is regulated by p53313 (see also below).
Somewhat similar to the role of PARP in BER, DDB is not required for human NER in
vitro, as became evident in a reconstitution experiment. Similar to PARP, it has therefore
been speculated that DDB is especially important in facilitating repair in a chromatin
context.For example,a role of DDB in nucleosome unfolding may be the key in providing
access to XPC and XPA and other components of the NER machinery to damaged DNA.
It is now generally assumed that GG-NER begins with the binding at the site of the
lesion of a heterodimer consisting of the XPC and HR23B proteins, facilitated as we have
seen by DDB (at least, for pyrimidine dimers). Binding of XPC/HR23B and, possibly, its
action in increasing the DNA backbone distortion, permits the binding of TFIIH, which
plays a very similar role as in TC-NER; opening up the helix through the helicase activity
of two of its 10 subunits, XPB and XPD. Here again we should pause to mention the exis-
tence of human heritable diseases caused by mutations in some of these genes. Mutations
in XPC or XPD can result in XP,whereas mutations in XPB cause XPCS,a combination of
XP and Cockayne syndrome. Interestingly, different mutations in the same gene can lead
to different diseases.An extreme example is XPD,mutations in which can not only lead to
XP, but also to Cockayne syndrome or trichothiodystrophy. This strong, complicated dis-
ease link of NER explains much of its enormous appeal as a subject of study, to both basic
scientists and clinicians. A detailed discussion of NER-associated diseases is beyond the
scope of this book and the reader is referred to recent reviews314,315. However, the subject
will come back repeatedly.
Opening up the DNA helix by the action of TFIIH is followed by the recruitment of
XPA, RPA, and XPG; XPC and HR23B are released. RPA binds to both strands and keeps
them apart. XPA probably acts in damage veriﬁcation and in guiding subsequent cleav-
age of the damaged strand. At this stage GG-NER has come together with TC-NER.
Hence, the difference between the two sub-pathways is really in the damage-recognition
steps. Therefore, defects at this and the next stages affect NER as a whole. For example,
whereas defects in XPC affect only GG-NER and defects in CSA or CSB only TC-NER,
XPA inactivation silences the entire NER pathway. However, CSB (and possibly CSA)
may also be involved in general transcription316 and could be directly linked to BER
for the repair of oxidative damage317, which may explain why Cockayne syndrome is so
different from XP.

The downstream part of NER involves the incision at both sides of the lesion, at the
3' site by XPG and at the 5' site by a dimer composed of XPF and ERCC1. The distance
between the incisions is about 30 bases, but can vary with each repair event. The ERCC1–
XPF endonuclease is also essential for interstrand cross-link repair (see further below). It
should be noted that ERCC1 represents the formal nomenclature of the NER genes; that
is, excision repair cross complementing. The reason that it has no XP-derived name is the
absence of a patient with a mutation in this gene, which is in contrast to its sister subunit
XPF and the other endonuclease XPG. After dual incision, the gap is ﬁlled in by DNA
synthesis, using the opposite, normal DNA strand as a template, by DNA polymerases  
and , followed by ligation.
NER in E coli is very similar to NER in mammals, but simpler. However, it should be
noted that with respect to UV damage, bacteria, bacteriophages, and some eukaryotic
viruses contain up to three distinct mechanisms to initiate the repair of UV-induced
dipyrimidine adducts: NER, BER, and photoreversal. Photoreversal has been discussed.
To initiate BER, glycosylases, such as T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase or the Micrococcus
luteus UV endonuclease, are necessary240.
Similar to the situation in BER, genetically modiﬁed mice are now playing a major
role in unraveling the mechanisms of NER and the pathophysiological consequences of
deﬁciencies in its performance. One of the ﬁrst of these mouse models for NER was a
knockout of the gene XPA, made independently in the laboratories of Harry van Steeg
(Bilthoven, the Netherlands)318 and Kiyoji Tanaka (Osaka, Japan)319. Similar to their
human counterparts, these mice were highly sensitive to genotoxic agents inducing bulky
adducts, such as UV or benzo(a)pyrene. By now, almost all gene defects involved in NER-
related diseases have been modeled in the mouse, most of them in the laboratory of Jan
Hoeijmakers (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Hoeijmakers and collaborators were able to
model, in the mouse, many of the exact same mutations in NER genes that caused these
different diseases in humans, thereby mimicking their human phenotypes to an often
remarkable extent. Interestingly, it was noted in the course of this work that several of
these mouse mutants displayed multiple symptoms of premature aging, a phenomenon
extensively discussed in Chapter 5.
Taken together, there can be no doubt about the importance of NER as a major repair
pathway, especially in humans. However, the fact that elimination of this pathway is not
embryonically lethal (except when the gene is also involved in some other basic function,
such as general transcription) indicates that NER is not as important as BER.This may be
especially true in the mouse, since in the above-mentioned mutant mouse models symp-
toms were often considerably less severe than in their human counterparts. There are two
possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that NER in humans is mainly
important as a defense against UV. Since rodents are nocturnal animals and have a fur,
they normally do not encounter any UV damage. This is illustrated by the aforemen-
tioned XPA-knockout mouse, which only showed symptoms when its (shaved) skin is
118
GENOME MAINTENANCE

challenged with UV or when it is fed compounds that induce bulky adducts, such as
benzo(a)pyrene.
Second, it is possible that NER gains in importance at older ages, for example, in a pos-
sible backup role for BER. Rodents generally have a short lifespan and may need NER to a
much lesser extent than humans. Indeed, there are now a number of cases in which the
consequences of a DNA-repair defect appear to be much less severe in mice than in
humans. This will be further discussed in Chapter 5.
The argument that NER is less important for rodents than humans can be illustrated
by the so-called rodent repairadox, which has direct relevance for the relationship
between DNA repair and aging320. Shortly after the clinical importance of NER was
realized—with its absence in cells from XP patients so dramatically illustrated using the
new autoradiographic assay—the wide diversity of DNA-repair processes was not
immediately known. Indeed, UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in cultured skin
cells was often considered as a measure of the total DNA-repair capacity of the organism.
Subsequent studies by Ronald Hart in the laboratory of Dick Setlow revealed a roughly
linear correlation between UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in skin ﬁbroblasts
cultured from different species—shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant, and
human—and the lifespan of the species (plotted on a logarithmic scale)238.Most striking
of these results was the dramatic difference between human and rodent cells. Indeed,
around this time data from a number of laboratories indicated the almost complete lack
of UV-induced CPD removal from rodent cells,an activity clearly present in human cells
under the same conditions321,322.Although also in human cells the repair of CPDs is slow
(about 80% in 24 h in cultured ﬁbroblasts), the almost complete absence of this activity
in rodent cells was considered strange in view of the fact that the survival rate of human
and rodent cells upon UV irradiation is very similar322.
The difference in CPD repair between rodent and human cells is likely due to a deﬁ-
ciency in rodent cells of the stimulation of NER by p53. The p53 tumor suppressor, an
important mediator of cellular responses to DNA damage, affects the efﬁciency of NER
by transcriptionally regulating the expression of the DDB2 gene (encoding the p48 pro-
tein) and the XPC gene, two important components of the NER pathway involved in
DNA damage recognition.Whereas heritable mutations in the human DDB2 gene gener-
ate the E subgroup of XP (XPE), in rodent cells this gene is not induced by p53. The
absence of a fully functional DDB causes a deﬁciency in global genome repair of CPDs (as
well as 6–4PPs and possibly other types of lesion). By contrast, TC-NER in rodent cells is
fully functional and it is likely that this proﬁciency in repairing UV-induced pyrimidine
dimers in transcribed DNA strands explains why the survival of rodent cells after UV
irradiation is not different from that of human cells. Indeed, arrested RNA polymerase II
at a lesion is likely to induce apoptosis unless repair is swift266.
Based on the above, one would expect that defects in TC-NER alone would lead to
increased levels of apoptosis, thereby eliminating cells with a severely damaged genome
GENOME MAINTENANCE
119

and reducing cancer risk. On the other hand, defects in GG-NER alone may lead to
increased genome instability but not to elevated levels of apoptotic cells. This is in
keeping with results obtained after comparing mice with defects in XPC (no GG-NER),
CSB (no TC-NER),and XPA (no NER) for signs of increased genome instability or apop-
tosis. XPC-deﬁcient mice were shown to rapidly accumulate somatic mutations at the
Hprt locus323 in T lymphocytes as well as in liver, spleen, kidney and lung at a lacZ trans-
gene locus (S. Wijnhoven, personal communication). These results are in keeping with
the observation that XPC-deﬁcient mice develop multiple spontaneous lung tumors324.
CSB-null mice displayed no such increased genomic instability at a lacZ transgene
locus325,but instead increased levels of apoptotic cells (Y.Suh,personal communication).
In XPA-deﬁcient mice both an increased level of genomic instability in liver and kidney325
and increased numbers of apoptotic cells (Y. Suh, personal communication) were found.
Whereas in the XPA mutant the absence of TC-NER would cause apoptosis, as in the
CSB-deﬁcient mouse, this may not be enough to entirely eliminate cells with accumu-
lated damage due to the defect in GG-NER, which is also present in this mouse model.
At the time the Hart and Setlow paper appeared, the mechanistic details discussed
above were not known.It is possible that the low level of UV-induced GG-NER in rodents
simply reﬂects an adaptation to nocturnal life. Interestingly, Kato et al.326, who greatly
expanded the Hart and Setlow study, observed very low UV-induced repair synthesis in
cells from bats,nocturnal animals that are long-lived.Of note,unscheduled DNA synthe-
sis as a measure for NER can be inﬂuenced by numerous confounding factors,such as cell
geometry, nucleoside pool sizes, and [3H]thymidine uptake. Based on the results thus far
it is not possible to conclude that species-speciﬁc lifespan correlates with DNA-repair
capacity. The lesson here is probably that we still lack comprehensive insight into the
various ways an organism maintains its genome and how the various characteristics of
the pathways to preserve the integrity of our genes impact on the process of aging (see
below). In this respect, as we shall see, NER remains a very interesting system.
4.3.3.3 Mismatch repair (MMR)
The third excision-repair pathway,MMR,is primarily devoted to the excision of mispaired
nucleotides or short loops generated by insertions or deletions of nucleotides. These are
typically errors made by the DNA-replicative machinery and MMR serves the purpose of
correcting such errors. This makes MMR a postreplication repair system which comple-
ments an error-correction mechanism that is already part of many DNA polymerases.
This built-in correction system is called proofreading and it is the primary line of defense
against mistakes in newly synthesized DNA. When an incorrect base pair is recognized,
DNA polymerase reverses its direction by 1 bp of DNA. The 3' →5' exonuclease activity
of the enzyme allows the incorrect base pair to be excised. Following base excision, the
polymerase can re-insert the correct base and replication can continue. MMR, therefore,
120
GENOME MAINTENANCE

is an additional safeguard against errors during information transfer. The process is dis-
tinct from the two other excision-repair pathways in the sense that it relies on a way of dis-
tinguishing the newly replicated from the parental DNA strand. The mechanism by
which MMR in eukaryotes is directed to the newly synthesized strand is as yet unknown.
In E. coli,which has a very similar system to repair replication errors,the strand harboring
the mispaired base is distinguished from the parental strand by adenine methylation on
the latter. However, methylation in eukaryotes is different from prokaryotes and it is
possible that part of the increased complexity of MMR in eukaryotes is due to the need
for alternative mechanisms of strand discrimination.
MMR in eukaryotes involves homologs of the E. coli MutS and MutL proteins, but is
much more complex. A dimer of the MutS homologous MSH2 and MSH6 proteins
(MutS) recognizes mismatches and single-base loops, whereas the MSH2–MSH3 dimer
(MutS
) recognizes insertion and deletion loops. Then, the MutL-like protein complexes
MLH1–PMS2 and MLH1–PMS1 bind to the MSH2–MSH6 and MSH2–MSH3 MutS
homologs,respectively,after which the complexes can migrate in either direction.It is not
only strand discrimination that remains unclear in eukaryotes; the excision step does as
well. Evidence has been obtained, using a cell-free system, that the PCNA/RFC clamp and
clamp-loader pair interact with MSH and MLH proteins to direct excision of the mis-
match on the nascent strand through exonuclease327. The details of this process are still
unknown in mammalian cells in vivo.
Errors in DNA replication are not the only substrate for MMR. MMR plays a role in
preventing strand exchange between divergent DNA sequences during HR, and in this
sense functions as a monitor of meiotic and mitotic recombination. MMR acts as a
barrier against the exchange of DNA molecules from unrelated organisms by aborting
mismatched heteroduplexes. MMR is also capable of recognizing DNA damage other
than mismatches. An example is its action in stabilizing hairpin structures that arise
during BER of SSBs in repetitive stretches of microsatellite triplet repeats328. Such action
may allow repeat expansion in postmitotic cells, such as in the brain of patients with
Huntington’s disease (see Chapter 3). Lack of MSH2 interrupts the progressive repeat
expansion that has been demonstrated in the mouse model for this disease329. As already
brieﬂy discussed in the section on DNA-damage signaling, MMR appears to be active
also in DNA-damage signaling, including the signaling of an apoptotic response. Finally,
Donald MacPhee (Melbourne, Australia) has suggested that MMR also acts in non-
dividing cells in the repair of mismatches generated during error-prone repair or as a
consequence of mitotic recombination330. Repair of such mismatches by MMR in a 
non-dividing cell would result in mutations some 50% of the time because there is no way
to distinguish the correct from the wrong base.
Whereas NER deﬁciencies will always be associated with XP, MMR genetic defects
are responsible for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), a human auto-
somal dominant disorder characterized by a strong predisposition to develop tumors,most
GENOME MAINTENANCE
121

notably tumors of the colon331. Most HNPCC cases are caused by mutations in MLH1 or
MSH2. Cells from tumors of these patients display instability of the small repeat-element
clusters called microsatellites (see Chapter 3).This is due to the tendency of the replication
machinery to slip when encountering stretches of short repeat elements, resulting in the
loss or addition of one or more repeat units. Such slippage replication errors result in the
short insertion or deletion loops,which can only be repaired by MMR.
We know that MMR defects are associated with microsatellite instability because we
can readily detect such events from analyzing the tumor DNA. The single germ-line
mutation in an MMR gene in an individual with HNPCC does not result in MMR deﬁ-
ciency. It is a second hit in the remaining functional allele in a tumor that eliminates
MMR and results in such high levels of alteration in the notoriously unstable microsatel-
lites that it can be detected directly.However,this microsatellite instability reﬂects a much
broader genomic instability, known as a mutator phenotype, which helps the tumor cell
to acquire new attributes for unhindered growth (see also Chapter 6). This explains the
predisposition to cancer of MMR genetic defects in HNPCC. Indeed, genomic instability
and predisposition to cancer are hallmarks of MMR defects, more so than in the case of
NER defects. This is best illustrated by the MMR-deﬁcient mouse models that have been
generated. MMR-defective mice, as a consequence of the inactivation of any of the MutS
or MutL homologs, develop both lymphomas, a common spontaneous tumor in normal
mice at advanced age, and intestinal tumors. These mice usually die of cancer as early as
6 months of age332.
To study mutations other than microsatellite instability, MMR-defective mice were
crossed with other mouse strains harboring bacterial reporter genes that can be recovered
from the mouse genome and tested in E. coli for mutations (see Chapter 6 for a detailed
explanation of such mouse models).Such reporter loci are more similar to gene sequences
than microsatellites and therefore a better marker for overall genome instability. Using
such hybrid mouse models it was found that this high susceptibility to cancer of MMR-
defective mice is associated with dramatically increased levels of genomic instability. For
example, in the absence of any mutagenic treatment, mice lacking PMS2 showed a 100-
fold elevation in mutation frequencies in all tissues examined,as compared with the wild-
type or heterozygous animals333.Most of these mutations were deletions and insertions of
one nucleotide within mononucleotide repeat sequences, which is consistent with the
role of MMR in the excision of mismatches caused by slippage during replication.
As we have seen in the case of NER, it is often informative to model human disease-
causing mutations in the mouse, rather than generating complete knockouts. Indeed, in
many cases these disease-causing mutations do not completely eliminate gene function,
but only affect part of it. MMR mouse lines have been generated that harbor speciﬁc
mutations causing HNPCC in humans.Analysis of cells from such knockin mice revealed
that whereas MMR knockouts lacked both mismatch repair and the apoptosis response,
an MSH2-speciﬁc mutation inactivated only the former.Whereas the mutant MSH2–MSH6
122
GENOME MAINTENANCE

complex retained normal mismatch recognition and, hence, can presumably still signal
apoptosis, it lost its capacity to initiate the next stage in MMR. To retain the apoptotic
response is obviously advantageous because mutant cells that fail to be repaired by MMR
can be eliminated. This is in keeping with an observed signiﬁcantly longer lifespan of
these mice compared with the complete MMR-knockout mice. Nevertheless, eventually
they also succumbed to cancer (about 6 months later) and their cells also displayed
increased mutation rates334. Interestingly, this separation of the repair function from the
DNA-damage signaling function of MMR would rule out the futile repair hypothesis
described in section 4.2.6.
MMR-deﬁcient mice show increased predisposition to cancer but not premature
aging. In this respect, it is of interest to compare the MMR-deﬁcient mouse models with
the previously discussed NER models. Whereas a deﬁciency in NER can also predispose
to cancer (as, for example, in XP), several NER mutants are not cancer-prone. Some,
including mice with a mutational defect in the XPD gene, which in humans causes tri-
chothiodistrophy, are even resistant to cancer335. There are two possible explanations for
this difference. First, as we have seen, MMR-defective mice lack an apoptotic response, an
important barrier against cancer. In NER-deﬁcient mice this response is not only
retained, but likely plays a major role in reducing cancer in some of these mutants and
promoting some of the degenerative aspects of aging (Chapter 5). Second, as we have
seen, MMR defects can result in very high levels of genomic instability, much higher than
what has been observed in most NER-deﬁcient mice. It is likely that this increased muta-
genesis, which mainly involves small mutations, is the cause of the greatly elevated cancer
risk. This is because it increases the chance of mutations in genes that are critical for
cancer development or progression. However, point mutations may contribute less to the
non-cancer-related, degenerative aspects of aging. As we will see later in the book, it is
possible that this non-cancer component of the aging phenotype is caused by other types
of random genome alteration, such as large genome rearrangements. Such events are
introduced into the genome as a consequence of erroneous repair of DNA double-strand
lesions. It is to the repair of this type of DNA damage that I will now turn.
4.3.4 REPAIR OF DNA DOUBLE-STRAND LESIONS
DNA double-strand lesions are forms of DNA damage that affect both strands simultane-
ously at opposite sites that are sufﬁciently close together to prevent the use of excision
repair. The model lesion for the types of repair that are usually employed to overcome
double-strand lesions is the DNA double-strand break DSB; that is, when two or more
breaks are formed in opposite strands of DNA within about 10–20 bp of each other. DSBs
are induced by ioniz-ing radiation or ROS, and can also arise as a consequence of replica-
tion-fork collapse—when encountering DNA damage or difﬁcult-to-resolve secondary
GENOME MAINTENANCE
123

structures.The best example of the latter is the passing of a replication fork through a SSB,
which will then be converted to a DSB on one of the sister chromatids.DSBs are also gener-
ated deliberately,as part of the process of V(D)J recombination in B and T lymphocytes,to
generate antigen-binding diversity in the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor proteins.In
this process DSBs are generated at speciﬁc sites by a nuclease composed of the RAG1 and
RAG2 proteins.After these controlled,site-speciﬁc rearrangement events,the repair of the
resulting DSBs employs the same non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) process used by
the cell to repair randomly induced,so-called illegitimate,DSBs (see below).
DSBs and double-strand lesions in general are highly toxic and their correct repair is
critical for the cell to survive. Incorrectly repaired or persistent DSBs can cause chromo-
somal aberrations, such as deletions, insertions, and translocations, the spontaneous
accumulation of which may play a causal role in age-related cellular degeneration and
death. Most DSBs are likely to be repaired by either HR or NHEJ. Of these two processes,
HR is generally thought to be error-free since it employs a homologous DNA molecule,
usually a sister chromatid,as template to overcome the break.As will be described in more
detail below, NHEJ merely joins the ends of breaks without the option of distinguishing
one end from another when a cell suffers from more than one DSB at the same time.
As for all DNA-repair pathways, there are strong interactions between DNA-damage
sensors and the repair of DSBs, in this case especially ATM. The DSB signaling cascade,
involving ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, and other proteins, leading to the activation of various
downstream substrates, such as p53, has already been discussed. Although the details
regarding the coordination between DNA-damage sensors and the various DNA-repair
executive branches are not clear yet, components of DNA-damage signaling are known
to be involved in repair per se.The role of ATM and especially DNA-PK in activating NHEJ
has already been mentioned. In addition, ATM phosphorylates active participants in HR,
including BRCA1. The DNA-damage checkpoints are also thought to be responsible for
the p53-dependent elevation of the levels of deoxyribonucleotides in the nucleus to facili-
tate the DNA synthesis steps of DSB repair336.Most importantly,DNA-damage sensors are
thought to play a major role in facilitating access of the repair enzymes to the sites of dam-
age by reorganizing chromatin structure. We have seen that this is true for the excision-
repair pathways and it applies equally well to DSB repair. As already discussed, chromatin
remodeling as a prelude to DSB repair is triggered in mammalian cells by phosphorylation
of H2AX by ATM or DNA-PK. Finally, if all else fails, the damage signaling pathways may
lead a cell into apoptosis or cellular senescence.Since DSBs are so toxic,it is likely that they
contribute signiﬁcantly to both spontaneous apoptosis events and the accumulation of
senescent cells over a lifetime in a given mammalian tissue.As will be discussed in Chapters
5 and 7, apoptosis and cellular senescence are two of the three major cellular endpoints
contributing to aging,neoplastic transformation being the third.Unfortunately,we do not
yet know how a cell decides to enter apoptosis or cellular senescence. It is possible that,
similar to the decision to abandon repair, it is the amount of damage that dictates whether
a cell should die or enter a state of permanent replication arrest.

GENOME MAINTENANCE

Below I will brieﬂy discuss the two major pathways for repairing DSBs and the physio-
logical consequences associated with their action or lack of action. For more detailed dis-
cussions of the repair of double-strand lesions in general, including the highly toxic
interstrand cross-links, the reader is referred to several excellent recent reviews337–340.
4.3.4.1 Repair by homologous recombination (HR)
Repair by recombination is probably the most ancient form of repair in the living world.
It has been proposed that sexual reproduction,which is essentially HR contributing to the
generation of genetic diversity, arose very early in evolution as a way of overcoming dam-
age in the genome165. A model for an early form of recombinational repair has been
presented by Michael Cox (Madison, MI, USA)164, which is essentially a form of postrepli-
cation repair, applicable to either an RNA or DNA genome, that requires an homologous
double-stranded nucleic acid from elsewhere.
Most of our knowledge of HR as a mechanism to overcome DSBs stems from work
with bacteria and yeast. This has resulted in the elegant DSB-repair model for meiotic
recombination by Szostak et al.341. The pathway is obviously well conserved and critically
important in mammals.The mechanism of the repair of DSBs by HR in mammalian cells
is essentially similar to the Szostak model or the ancient form of HR proposed by Cox.
Before strand invasion, the ﬁrst major step in HR, the ends of the DSB undergo resection
in the 5' to 3' direction by the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity of the MRN complex (see sec-
tion on DNA-damage sensors). This results in 3' single-stranded tails, the targets for a
complex of proteins originally discovered in yeast and known as the RAD52 group.
Mammalian homologs of all the factors in this group have been described.From the mol-
ecules in this group, it is the RAD51 protein that acts as the mammalian counterpart of
E. coli RecA by forming a nucleoprotein ﬁlament that coats the single strands and invades
the exchange partner of the damaged DNA. Once identiﬁed, the homologous sequence is
subsequently used as a template for DNA synthesis to extend the single-strand DNA tails.
The strands are sealed to the correct parental strand by DNA ligase. The resulting
Holliday junctions are resolved by resolvases to yield two intact DNA molecules. This
leads to crossover and non-crossover products, depending on the mechanism of resolu-
tion.As we will see later, the protein helicase encoded by the BLM gene, which is defective
in the human disease Bloom syndrome, plays an important role in the resolution process.
There is still considerable debate about the details of HR, which may not always be the
same and could also differ from species to species. The entire process, which involves
many different actors, including the above-mentioned BLM helicase and the breast can-
cer-susceptibility proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2, is concentrated in nuclear foci. These foci
can be visualized under the microscope after ﬂuorescent staining with antibodies against
one or more of the participants.
In principle,HR is error-free,since it uses a clean copy of the damaged DNA molecule as
a template. The ideal template in this respect is a sister chromatid, which is why HR is
GENOME MAINTENANCE
125

thought to be particularly active in repairing DSBs that are induced during the S/G2 phase
of the cell cycle.However,HR could also use the homologous chromosome as its exchange
partner during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, when a sister chromatid is not present. This
requires searching around in the nucleus for the homolog, a cumbersome process which
may explain why G1 cells prefer to repair DSBs through NHEJ (see below).
Another reason to avoid the homologous chromosome as template for HR is the possi-
bility that mutations arise as a consequence of crossing-over. In the absence of crossing-
over the repaired segment will simply acquire the donor sequence,a form of nonreciprocal
transfer called gene conversion.With crossing-over,however,large parts of a chromosome
are exchanged with a substantially increased risk of loss of heterozygosity (LOH); that
is, the loss of the single functional allele when the other is already inactive due to a pre-
existing mutation. This is a major reason to avoid crossing-over when resolving Holliday
junctions. Candidate proteins for resolving Holliday junctions in mammalian cells (and
possibly also in yeast) without crossover products include the protein encoded by the BLM
gene,a member of the RecQ family (see below).
In spite of the penalty,mitotic recombinations do occur as demonstrated342,indicating
that HR does occasionally use the homologous chromosome as template, thereby gener-
ating crossover products. However, they would probably occur much more frequently
were it not for its apparent suppression by MMR components on the basis of sequence
differences between the potential exchange partners. This effect of increased genetic dis-
tance has been demonstrated by a comparison of progeny from crosses between strains of
mice with signiﬁcantly diverged nucleotide sequences; in progeny of such strains, mitotic
recombination is hardly detectable343 (see also Chapter 6).
The impact of mitotic recombination on spontaneous levels of genomic instability
during aging of mammals is unclear. In budding yeast, however, a dramatic increase in
LOH events during replicative aging of this organism has been reported151.This phenom-
enon is unrelated to the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles in yeast
mother cells (see Chapter 2), which appeared to cause replicative aging in at least some
strains of yeast and may also arise as a consequence of illegitimate recombination events.
The possible relationship of these two forms of genomic instability in yeast to the aging
process will be discussed extensively in Chapter 7.
Another disadvantage of HR repair in G1 involves the possibility of a DSB occurring in
any of the large number of repeat elements in the mammalian genome.In the absence of a
conveniently lined-up sister chromatid, this could easily lead to the selection of a repeat
family member on another chromosome as exchange partner. This would result in chro-
mosomal translocations. When the exchange partner is a repeat family member on the
same chromosome this would result in deletions, a potential mechanism for the appear-
ance of extrachromosomal circular DNA in aging yeast mother cells. Whereas in mam-
mals there is no evidence that extrachromosomal circles accumulate with age as in yeast,
extrachromosomal DNA is common and possibly also a consequence of erroneous
126
GENOME MAINTENANCE

recombinational repair152 (see also Chapter 6).To limit such instability,HR is restricted to
late S and G2, but it is nevertheless possible that a signiﬁcant portion of the chromosomal
aberrations as they are observed in human and animal cells are a result of such illegiti-
mate recombinations.
Finally, in an error-prone variant of HR DSBs are repaired in a pathway that does not
use the sequence information from a sister chromatid or homologous chromosome. This
mechanism is called single-strand annealing. Like HR, single-strand annealing requires
the presence of DNA sequence homology, in this case in the form of complementary
sequences on both sites of the break. The process begins very similar to HR by resecting
the 5' ends of the break. This resection exposes complementary regions within the 3' over-
hangs,usually repeat sequences.In mammalian cells such repeats are of course frequently
present. Annealing takes place at these repeats with the loss of the ﬂap-overhangs (by a
FEN1-like nuclease). Loss of the sequence between the repeats is the inevitable result of
single-strand annealing, which is therefore always mutagenic.
Apart from DSBs, HR is also involved in repairing the highly toxic interstrand cross-
links339. Interstrand cross-links are induced by chemotherapeutic agents, such as mito-
mycin C, and cisplatin, but also by natural compounds in plants as well as endogenous
agents formed during lipid peroxidation. To effectively remove interstrand cross-links,
different repair pathways have to act in concert. Repair of interstrand cross-links in E. coli
has been well characterized and is based on incisions by the NER enzymes UvrABC, fol-
lowed by HR.Alternatively, a combination of NER and translesion synthesis is employed.
As expected, in yeast and mammalian cells the situation is somewhat similar, but more
complicated. In mammalian cells it is unknown how the interstrand cross-links are rec-
ognized. Also the precise role of the NER enzymes in mammalian cells is unclear.
However, Chinese hamster ovary cells with defects in the endonuclease ERCC1–XPF are
exquisitely sensitive for agents that induce interstrand cross-links. Moreover, ERCC1-
knockout mice have a much more severe phenotype than other NER mutant mice. They
are not only UV-sensitive, but display premature aging symptoms and live only for a few
weeks (for a more detailed discussion of this mouse model, see Chapter 5). Like the
ERCC1–XPF mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells, cells from these mice are very sensitive
to mitomycin C and other agents that induce interstrand cross-links.There is no evidence
that XPG, the other endonuclease active in NER, plays a role in interstrand cross-link
repair. The role of ERCC1–XPF in repair of interstrand cross-links is unclear and it may
be based on its function in removing the non-homologous DNA tails during HR.
Defects in interstrand-cross-link repair have been implicated as the cause of Fanconi
anemia,a rare,autosomal recessive disorder,with developmental abnormalities,progressive
bone-marrow failure,and a greatly increased risk of cancer344.The disorder is characterized
and diagnosed by the sensitivity of the patient’s cells to agents inducing interstrand cross-
links. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with as many as 12 comple-
mentation groups identiﬁed, corresponding to defects in distinct genes involved in the
GENOME MAINTENANCE
127

genome-maintenance pathway represented by this disease. Some protein products of the
identiﬁed genes have been shown to functionally or physically interact with BRCA1,
RAD51, and the MRN complex. Indeed, one protein, FANCD1, was identiﬁed as BRCA2,
a human breast cancer-susceptibility gene. Like BRCA1, this gene has been implicated
directly in the process of HR repair (see above). The function of most of the Fanconi
anemia proteins is still unclear, as is the exact nature of the condition, which is also
characterized by symptoms of oxidative stress.
4.3.4.2 Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
In yeast, HR is the preferential pathway to repair DSBs, although NHEJ also occurs. This
is different in mammals, in which NHEJ is extensively employed. This difference in pref-
erence is likely to be due to the greatly increased time mammalian cells in vivo spend in G1
or G0. Indeed, NHEJ seems to be especially important in differentiated cells; early in
development, HR is probably more important. In mammals, NHEJ is also used to repair
the RAG-generated DSBs in the process of V(D)J recombination. This can only occur by
NHEJ, as indicated by the observation that inactivation of each of the six NHEJ genes in
humans or mice prevents B- and T-cell maturation, resulting in severe combined
immunodeﬁciency (SCID)345.
The main player in NHEJ is the Ku heterodimer with its 70- and 80-kDa subunits,
known as Ku70 and Ku80, respectively. Ku80 is sometimes also referred to as Ku86.As we
have seen, Ku is a part of DNA-PK, which consists of the Ku heterodimer and DNA-PKCS,
the catalytic component with kinase activity upon binding to DNA ends. Ku, which is
basically a ring, binds to the DSB by threading its ends. In this way it holds them together,
probably protects them against nucleolytic attack, and also serves as the recruiting plat-
form for the repair proteins, including DNA-PKCS. The role of the latter in NHEJ is not
exactly clear. We have already seen that this giant protein kinase of the PIKK family, like
ATM and ATR, plays a role in DNA-damage sensing and signaling, especially in signaling
the apoptotic response. It also plays a role in telomere maintenance and it is activated by
bacterial DNA as part of the innate immune response. In NHEJ its function must be spe-
ciﬁc for vertebrates since they are the only organisms in which it has been identiﬁed.
Two molecules of DNA-PKCS on each side of the break may assist Ku to hold the DNA
ends together. The structures of these ends, however, are not amenable to a simple liga-
tion (as is also usually the case with SSBs; see above under BER). They may have single-
stranded overhangs and damaged bases or sugar moieties that require processing. It is
likely that the protein called Artemis plays an important role in resolving the various
DNA end modiﬁcations346. Artemis binds to DNA-PKCS and is phosphorylated. This
stimulates and extends the nuclease activity of Artemis, so that the protein becomes
capable of cutting away protruding single-stranded regions at DNA ends and creating
128
GENOME MAINTENANCE

double-stranded structures that are good ligase substrates. Other factors, such as the
Werner syndrome protein (WRN) and the previously discussed MRN complex may play
a role. The polymerases needed to ﬁll the gap are those belonging to the X family. These
enzymes, such as pol, pol
, or the terminal deoxytransferase (TdT), are apparently
utilized depending on the template. DNA ligation is subsequently carried out by ligase
IV in a complex with XRCC1.
NHEJ is active throughout the cell cycle in all vertebrate tissues and only competes with
HR in the S and G2 phases. In contrast to HR, NHEJ is error prone. Part of the necessary
processing of DNA ends before they can be religated is resection. We have seen this
happening in HR,which is not a problem since it relies on its identical sister chromatid to
retrieve the lost information. In NHEJ, however, such resection leads to the permanent
loss of between 1 and 20 nucleotides each time a DSB is repaired. Realizing the potential
impact of such a continual loss of small amounts of genomic sequence over the lifetime of
an organism, Michael Lieber (Los Angeles, CA, USA) has made an attempt to estimate its
consequences in terms of the loss of gene activity of an average cell347. Based on his esti-
mate of 5–10% of all cells harboring a DSB at all times and a repair time of 24 h,he calcu-
lated that at the end of a human life each cell would have 2300 imprecise repair sites
distributed throughout the genome. In a genome with 50 000 genes (we now know that
this is probably less) and only 5% of the genome functional (a very low estimate;Chapter 3),
he reached the not inconsiderable number of 430 genes being adversely affected.
A second potential source of errors associated with NHEJ is its lack of a mechanism to
distinguish DNA ends corresponding to different DSBs arising in the same cell at the
same time. It is likely that NHEJ is responsible for random integration of transforming
DNA in transgenesis via sporadic DSBs in the chromosomes. It has been demonstrated
that by increasing the number of DSBs in a cell from one to two the frequency of translo-
cations is increased by at least 2000-fold348. The situation will be worse with more DSBs
in a single cell.Using 
H2AX as a marker for multiple DSBs induced by a linear track of 
particles, Aten et al.349 observed congregation of these breaks into small clusters in 
G1-phase cells. This supports the notion that distant DSBs can be juxtaposed, which
would greatly increase the generation of translocations. Whereas we may assume that Ku
would be quick enough to capture the ends of each DSB before they can ﬂoat apart, the
promiscuity of NHEJ could lead to chromosomal translocations, especially when multi-
ple DSBs are juxtaposed. Interestingly, whereas one might think that inactivation of
NHEJ would prevent such translocations (DNA ends cannot ligate to one another by
themselves) its absence in the mouse has been associated with increased chromosomal
aberrations350.It is possible that in such a situation HR functions as a back-up,inaccurate
in G1 as described above, or single-strand annealing of complementary single strands
from different chromosomes. Finally, non-classic forms of end-joining could be active
that have thus far been elusive.

4.3.4.3 Effect of DSB repair defects in animals
As for all genome-maintenance pathways,mouse models have been made in which HR or
NHEJ genes were inactivated. The results indicate that deﬁciencies in critical HR genes
are usually fatal,but those in genes involved in NHEJ generally not.For example,inactiva-
tion of key genes involved in the crucial strand-invasion step of HR, for example, RAD51
BRCA1, and BRCA2, is embryonically lethal. This lethality is understandable in view of
the role HR plays in repairing the DSBs that must arise when the replication fork meets a
SSB.By contrast,most gene deﬁciencies in core NHEJ genes,for example Ku70,Ku80,and
DNA-PKCS, result in viable mice. This lack of lethality must be due to the relative scarcity
of non-dividing cells during development. Indeed, the animals do suffer from SCID (due
to the defect in V(D)J recombination) and they show multiple symptoms of accelerated
aging (see Chapter 5).
4.3.5 ANCILLARY SYSTEMS
In addition to the main DNA-damage checkpoint and repair pathways discussed above, a
number of systems have been identiﬁed for resolving particular problems related to DNA
damage and genome instability.These systems often closely interact with the DNA-repair
systems per se; that is, those that act to remove lesions, such as the excision-repair sys-
tems. Here I will discuss three of such ancillary systems: telomerase, RecQ helicases,
including WRN,and DNA topoisomerases.Inactivating mutations in genes participating
in these systems in the mouse result in phenotypes resembling accelerated aging, similar
to the situation for NHEJ and NER.
4.3.5.1 Telomere maintenance
As discussed in Chapter 3, mammalian telomeres are composed of TTAGGG repeat
arrays bound by a complex of proteins and organized in a so-called T loop (Fig. 4.7a).
This prevents attack by DNA-repair enzymes, which would otherwise recognize these
chromosome ends as DSBs.In contrast to bacteria,which have a circular genome,eukary-
otes are unable to complete lagging-strand synthesis during replication (see Chapter 3 for
a detailed description). As a consequence, 50–200 bp of telomeric repeats are lost with
each cell division. The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) maintains telomere
length by copying a short template sequence within its intrinsic RNA moiety (TERC),
running 5' to 3' towards the end of the chromosome. It extends the 3' tail, after which
normal lagging-strand synthesis generates the opposite strand (Fig. 4.7b). This process
is controlled by regulator proteins, some of which (TRF1, TIN2) inhibit telomerase-
mediated lengthening to prevent unrestrained elongation of telomeres.
130
GENOME MAINTENANCE

Both telomeres and telomerase are important genome-maintenance systems.The T-loop
structure prevents NHEJ from fusing different chromosomes together and telomerase pre-
vents telomeres from becoming so short that they can no longer form T loops. Telomeres
that shorten to the point that they become dysfunctional cause replicative senescence by
activating p53.Inactivation of the p53 pathway allows cells to bypass replicative senescence
and proliferate until they reach a stage called crisis, which is characterized by widespread
chromosomal instability (with its characteristic telomeric end-to-end fusions), apoptosis,
mitotic catastrophe,and senescence,with the rare emergence of immortal cell clones all of
which have acquired a mechanism to re-stabilize their telomeres. The mechanism of such
genomic instability is not entirely clear but NHEJ is the most likely culprit351. Inactivation
of the p53 pathway is enough to bypass senescence due to telomere dysfunction.
Normal human cells do not express telomerase at all, except embryonic tissues, germ-
line tissues (testes and ovaries),and progenitor cells in tissues with high cell turnover,such
as bone marrow and intestinal crypts. As mentioned above, in the majority of human

of telomerase as it corrects the effects of the end-replication problem.

cancer cells telomerase activity is easily detectable. Such cells exhibit stable telomere
lengths upon extended propagation in culture and do not undergo replicative senescence.
In mouse cells, the situation is different in the sense that most laboratory strains have
very long telomeres and TERT, the gene encoding the telomerase reverse transcriptase
component, is widely expressed at low levels in adult tissues, with greatest abundance
during embryogenesis and in adult thymus and intestine352. The continued availability of
telomerase in mice could be a major factor determining its short lifespan as compared to
humans.Cancer,a major aging-related disease,is kept at bay much longer in humans than
in mice (in absolute time), possibly because of the strict regulation of telomerase as a
major gatekeeper to prevent immortalization. The difference in telomere length and
telomerase regulation also explains,at least in part,why senescence in mouse cells is funda-
mentally different from senescence in human cells353.
In humans, even a partial loss of telomerase function already causes serious disease.
This is illustrated by the human inherited disorder dyskeratosis congenita, an autosomal
dominant form of which is caused by mutations in one of the two copies of the gene that
encodes TERC, the RNA part of telomerase. These patients suffer from abnormalities in
the production of cells in the blood and in the gut, and have poor wound healing, early
baldness, hypogonadism, and lung ﬁbrosis. Not surprisingly, they generally die early.
From these symptoms it can be derived that the cells affected are progenitor cells in tis-
sues with a high cell turnover, which is very similar to the situation in Terc-deﬁcient mice.
In such animals symptoms manifest only after several generations because telomeres of
most laboratory strains of mice are so much longer than those of humans. Interestingly,
whereas the short telomeres in Terc-deﬁcient mice are associated with increased cancer
incidence as a consequence of the genomic instability, some tissues and cell types seem to
suffer less from cancer as compared with normal control mice. For example, late-genera-
tion Terc-null mice are resistant to skin tumorigenesis354. Reduced cancer has also been
observed in mice deﬁcient in both telomerase and p16 (INK4a)355. This may reﬂect slow
tumor progression in these tissues due to high levels of tumor cell death as a consequence
of their short telomeres, which would be in keeping with the need of most tumors to
stabilize telomeres, which is most easily accomplished by induction of telomerase (see
above). It is important to notice that these mice have intact DNA-damage responses.
Hence, whereas the increased genomic instability accelerates tumor formation, the con-
stitutive activation of DNA-damage response factors,such as p53,will greatly impair their
progression by inhibiting cellular proliferation. Impairment of cellular proliferation
through short telomeres will also adversely affect stem-cell reservoirs, which may explain
the premature appearance of multiple aging-related phenotypes in Terc-null mice. The
antagonism between cancer and aging and its possible implications for the causes of
normal aging will be discussed further in Chapters 5 and 7.
Clearly,in tissues with high cell turnover telomerase is critically important.However,it
is not the only system that can extend and maintain telomeres.As ﬁrst discovered in yeast356,
est1 mutants (lacking telomerase) can adapt to telomere erosion by two mechanisms
132
GENOME MAINTENANCE

termed type I and type II survival. Type I survivors require RAD51, a sure sign that HR is
involved357. Indeed, in mammals, the so-called alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT)
pathway was ﬁrst identiﬁed in replicatively immortal,tumor-derived cell lines that do not
express telomerase358. Dividing tumor cells cannot do without a mechanism to maintain
their telomeres and generally manage to switch telomerase on. If telomerase expression
cannot be restored, the ALT pathway is an alternative. Its activity can be recognized by the
accumulation of so-called ALT-PML bodies, a variant of the PML bodies mentioned in
Chapter 3, in this case consisting of DNA-repair proteins co-localized at telomeres.
Interestingly, HR may play a role in normal telomere maintenance as well. This is sug-
gested by the presence of RAD51D, one of the ﬁve RAD51 paralogs, at telomeres of nor-
mal mouse cells359. Its absence was shown to cause chromosomal aberrations, including
typical end-to-end fusions. Such chromosomal instability was also observed in telom-
erase-negative immortalized human cells in which RAD51D was suppressed by siRNA359.
Many different DNA-repair proteins have been localized at telomeres, including Ku,
DNA-PKCS, BRCA1, BRCA2, and the MRN complex, as well as the RecQ proteins WRN
and BLM (see below). It is possible that these repair factors play a role in maintaining
telomeres, perhaps in association with telomere-speciﬁc proteins. This is somewhat
paradoxical since many of these proteins are supposed to repair broken DNA molecules,
presumably including the ends of uncapped chromosomes360. In yeast, proteins of the
NHEJ system may be intimately involved in maintaining telomere length, as indicated by
the shortened telomeres in cells lacking either of the two Ku proteins. Also in mammals
there is evidence for DNA-repair proteins playing a role in normal telomere maintenance,
but the details of this involvement are still incompletely understood.Alternatively,telom-
eres could merely be a storage site for DNA-repair proteins, similar to nucleoli and PML
bodies.
Whereas we now know that repair proteins are located at telomeres and may even play
a role in telomere maintenance, the recognized telomere cap proteins, such as the telom-
ere repeat factors TRF1 and TRF2, are clearly the most important in this respect. As
already mentioned, TRF1, together with its interacting partners TRF2, TIN2, TANK 1,
and TANK 2,are regulators of telomere length361.Some of these factors negatively control
telomere length by promoting a telomeric architecture that limits the ability of telom-
erase to access telomeres. For example, dominant negative forms of TIN2 or TRF1 can
extend telomere length362. The importance of such regulation is illustrated by lack of
viability of TRF1-deﬁcient mice363. Interestingly, this embryonic lethality could not be
rescued by telomerase,suggesting that it is not due to uncapping or attrition of telomeres.
TRF2 has mainly been implicated in the formation of the T-loop structure and in pre-
venting repair enzymes from recognizing telomeres as DNA DSBs.After TRF2 deletion in
mouse cells, the telomeres lose the 3' overhang and are processed by the NHEJ pathway.
Overexpression of TRF2 in the mouse skin was found to resemble the NER disorder XP,
with keratinocytes from these animals hypersensitive to UV and DNA cross-linking
agents364. Skin cells of these mice were also found to have short telomeres and loss of the
GENOME MAINTENANCE
133

G-strand overhang. It was suggested that the increased TRF2 raises the activity of XPF
(with which it is known to interact, as with many other repair proteins) at telomeres,
possibly at the cost of XPF activity elsewhere in the genome, which may explain the
increased UV sensitivity.
Evidence is now emerging that whereas general DNA-repair proteins are important for
telomere maintenance, telomere-speciﬁc proteins may be important for genome mainte-
nance in general.Interestingly,TRF2 was recently found to quickly and transiently localize
at DSBs induced by a laser microbeam at all possible locations in the genome365.This sug-
gests a general role for TRF2 in genome maintenance, possibly in preventing premature
action of DNA-repair enzymes until the correct repair complex is assembled.
How important is telomere maintenance in the context of maintaining the genome
overall? As I will discuss in more detail in Chapter 6, telomere length measurements,
mainly in white blood cells, have revealed that telomeres shorten during human aging.
However, age-adjusted telomere length is highly variable, possibly because of heritable
factors and/or disease. This considerable individual heterogeneity and the overlap in
telomere lengths between young and elderly individuals renders any correlation weak and
the signiﬁcance unclear. Nevertheless, a relationship between enhanced telomere attri-
tion, reduced cancer, and a more pronounced manifestation of non-cancer, degenerative
symptoms of aging can be rationalized. Telomere shortening protects us from cancer by
impairing tumor cell proliferation, through cell-cycle arrest or by activating replicative
senescence and apoptosis. However, this would also result in a loss of functional cells,
which in turn can be expected to lead to age-related organ dysfunction.Adverse effects of
telomere shortening may be especially prominent in stem-cell reservoirs. Indeed, it has
been demonstrated that telomere shortening (in Terc-deﬁcient mice) inhibited mobiliza-
tion of epidermal stem cells out of their niche in hair follicles,whereas telomerase overex-
pression promoted stem-cell mobilization366. The latter is apparently not related to
telomere lengthening but a reﬂection of another TERT functional pathway367. On the
other hand, overexpression of TERT in mouse hematopoietic stem cells had no effect on
the transplantation capacity of these cells; irrespective of telomerase activity, such cells
could be transplanted for no more than four generations368. Of note, the situation could
be very different in humans due to a difference in telomere biology between the two
species. Nevertheless, it is possible that whereas telomere attrition is the main barrier of
replicative capacity of human cells in culture, it may not necessarily exert a major inﬂu-
ence on cells in vivo.
4.3.5.2 RecQ helicases and DNA topoisomerases
Members of the RecQ helicase family occur in organisms varying from prokaryotes to
mammals and are named after the RecQ protein originally identiﬁed in E.coli.In mammals
there are ﬁve RecQ helicases, defects in three of which have been associated with genomic
134
GENOME MAINTENANCE

instability, cancer, and premature aging in humans in the form of the heritable, segmental
progeroid disorders Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund–Thomson
syndrome369. The RecQ homologs share a central helicase domain, with only the Werner
syndrome protein WRN harboring an exonuclease activity as well. It is also Werner syn-
drome,and to a lesser extent Rothmund–Thomson syndrome,in which premature aging is
especially prominent; Bloom syndrome is mainly characterized by excessive tumor forma-
tion (see Chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion of segmental progeroid syndromes).
Most of what we know about RecQ helicases in mammals is derived from the properties of
the BLM and WRN proteins.
RecQ homologs are able to catalyze unwinding of many different DNA substrates,such
as forked DNA, Holliday junctions, and triple and tetraplex DNA (see Chapter 3).
Whereas all the probably multiple roles of RecQ homologs in genome maintenance are
not yet known, they are generally thought to be ancillary factors in replication, recombi-
nation, or repair by resolving secondary structures. The best-characterized RecQ protein
in this respect is BLM.As established by Ian Hickson (Oxford,UK) and collaborators,one
function of BLM, in concert with topoisomerase III(TOPIII; see below) is to resolve
recombination intermediates containing double Holliday junctions by a process they
called double Holliday junction dissolution370. This function is apparently speciﬁc for
BLM since WRN and other RecQ homologs cannot substitute for BLM in these dissolu-
tion reactions. Human Bloom-syndrome cells show a characteristically elevated level of
spontaneous exchanges between sister chromatids and homologous chromosomes,
which indicates increased HR. BLM’s resolution of recombination intermediates avoids
crossover events during HR.It was proposed that this would protect organisms with large
genomes, containing repetitive sequences, against mutagenic genome rearrangements as
a consequence of exchange between non-sisters. The danger of such erroneous forms of
HR in generating LOH events or other types of genomic mutation has already been men-
tioned in the section on HR. Since Bloom-syndrome cells are not hypersensitive to ioniz-
ing radiation, indicating that BLM is not essential for the repair of DSBs, it was proposed
that crossover suppression through this mechanism was especially important in the
repair of daughter strand gaps arising during replication of a damaged template. As dis-
cussed earlier, this postreplication mechanism for damage avoidance relies on HR.
Although none of the other RecQ family members is able to substitute for BLM in sup-
pressing crossing-over through Holliday-junction dissolution,they may all be involved in
decreasing genomic instability during some form of DNA transaction. This would
explain the increased genomic instability observed in cells from Bloom syndrome and
Werner syndrome as well as the high cancer incidence. It should be noted that mutant
cells from both Werner syndrome and Bloom syndrome are viable and the existence
of the human syndromes shows that impairment of RecQ functions is not incompatible
with life, but merely increases spontaneous levels of genomic instability and cancer.
However, in mice complete BLM deﬁciency is embryonically lethal371,372 and it is likely
GENOME MAINTENANCE
135

that this is true also in most human cases. Indeed, Bloom syndrome is much rarer
than expected from the number of heterozygotes. So it is likely that only some allelic
combinations allow for pre- and postnatal survival. WRN-deﬁcient mice show virtually
no phenotypic differences from their wild-type counterparts,unless they also harbor null
mutations in Terc, Atm, or p53 (see Chapter 5).
Whereas BLM and WRN display a vast overlap in function in vitro,there are signiﬁcant
differences in vivo.Of the two syndromes,Bloom syndrome is the most severe,with death
usually before the age of 30.Werner syndrome patients die about 20 years later, mostly of
cancer and cardiovascular disease. Cancer in Werner syndrome develops much later than
in Bloom syndrome and is restricted to tumors derived from mesenchymal cells. Cells
from Werner syndrome do not show the greatly increased rate of sister chromatid
exchange as Bloom-syndrome cells. There is evidence that the WRN protein is required
for maintaining telomere function during replication. Cells lacking WRN have been
demonstrated to suffer from a loss of telomeric sequences from a single sister chromatid,
which was explained by a defect in lagging strand synthesis373. Telomere loss was depend-
ent on the helicase function of WRN alone and could be counteracted by expression of
telomerase.
WRN has an exonuclease function that BLM lacks. It is possible that the exonuclease
activity is needed to process telomeric DNA. Another difference between the two RecQ
homologs is that WRN, but not BLM, plays a role in NHEJ. This can be derived from
observations that WRN binds to the Ku70-Ku80 component of DNA-PK, which stimu-
lates the exonuclease, but not the helicase activity of WRN374. There is evidence that
WRN acts in optimizing the repair functions of NHEJ and HR375. Nevertheless, at least in
mice, its role in these processes cannot be that important since WRN-null mice do not
suffer from similar problems as other mouse models in which a NHEJ or HR core protein
has been inactivated.
RecQ proteins have many binding partners among DNA-repair and -replication pro-
teins, as can be expected from their role in assisting in the seamless performance of these
processes. A most frequently found interaction is with DNA TOPIII, which is a type I
topoisomerase. Type I DNA topoisomerases can change the topological status of the DNA
by introducing a DNA SSB and then transfer another DNA strand through this break. By
doing this they change the degree of supercoiling of the DNA.Physical interaction between
Sgs1, the yeast RecQ helicase, and BLM with TOPIII has been described for yeast and
human cells, respectively. Deletion of the TOPIII homolog in yeast (TOP3) results in slow
growth, hyper-recombination, genomic instability, impaired sporulation, and increased
sensitivity to genotoxic agents376. Interestingly, this phenotype is suppressed by deletion
of Sgs1, the yeast RecQ helicase, indicating that Sgs1 creates a deleterious topological
substrate that needs to be resolved by TOP3377. In vertebrates, there are two isoforms of
TOPIII, termed and 
. The human BLM protein functionally interacts with TOPIII. In
mice, deletion of TOPIIIis embryonically lethal. By contrast, mice lacking TOPIII
 are
136
GENOME MAINTENANCE

viable and grow to maturity with no apparent defects. However, once adults these animals
show a reduced lifespan and display lesions in multiple organs resembling premature
aging (see Chapter 5). It is conceivable that this effect is due to impairment of a RecQ
family member rather than a direct consequence of the lack of TOPIII
. Thus far, there is
no evidence that WRN interacts with TOPIII. However, it has been demonstrated that the
WRN protein physically and functionally interacts with TOPI378.
4.3.6 DNA REPAIR AND CHROMATIN
Nucleosomes are severe obstacles for processing of DNA lesions and must be disrupted to
allow repair. This has been studied most intensively for NER, especially after UV damage.
Since the chromatin remodeling events necessary for disruption and restoration of nucle-
osomal structure associated with DNA repair are likely to depend on the type of lesion
and repair pathway involved, we are still far from a comprehensive insight into these
processes and their impact on genome stability in aging organisms.
As we have seen, chromatin structure contains epigenetic information essential for
genome functioning, which is encoded in the speciﬁc patterns of DNA methylation and
histone modiﬁcation.Are there chromatin-repair systems and what are the potential con-
sequences of incomplete or erroneous restoration of higher-order DNA structure? One
important player that has thus far been identiﬁed is the chromatin assembly factor 
CAF-1379. This multimeric protein speciﬁcally deposits histones onto DNA that has been
subject to DNA-repair synthesis. This is very similar to chromatin assembly following
DNA replication, which also requires the CAF-1 complex (Chapter 3). As in replication,
CAF-1 recruitment depends on its interaction with PCNA. It has been demonstrated that
CAF-1 is recruited to sites of NER (or SSB repair), but not in cells that are deﬁcient in
repair, such as XP cells. Yeast deleted for the gene encoding CAF-1 is highly sensitive to
double-strand DNA-damaging agents380.
It has been suggested that CAF-1 can also act as a chaperone in mediating the correct
re-assembly of the histones displaced during repair.Indeed,another candidate chromatin
repair protein is the histone chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1).It is unclear as to
how and where this protein acts,but it is known to enhance the nucleosome-depositioning
activity of CAF-1. In yeast, asf1 mutants are sensitive to DNA damage, suggesting its
involvement in maintaining chromatin structure after repair381.
Whereas it is unknown whether aberrant or incomplete chromatin repair can lead to
loss of genome integrity through epigenetic changes, evidence for both incomplete
restoration of DNA-methylation patterns after repair and methylation changes with age
has been obtained (Chapter 6).Methylation patterns are established during embryogene-
sis and remain largely unchanged in adult cells382. Genome-wide demethylation occurs
before embryo implantation followed by de novo global remethylation (by DNMT3a and
GENOME MAINTENANCE
137

DNMT3b de novo DNA methyltransferases) after implantation,before organ development.
This allows gene-speciﬁc methylation patterns to develop,which determine tissue-speciﬁc
transcription repression, including repression of either the maternal or paternal allele of
imprinted genes. Once established during early life, methylation patterns are replicated
during mitosis by the enzyme DNMT1, a maintenance DNA methyltransferase.
However, methylation patterns are not completely stable. Gradual hypomethylation of
the mammalian genome occurs with age in most tissues as well as aberrant hypermethy-
lation in the promoter regions of genes (see Chapter 6). Interestingly, it has been demon-
strated that after UV irradiation of non-dividing cells in culture restoration of the
methylation patterns after the resynthesis step of NER was slow and incomplete383. This
could explain the observed gradual demethylation associated with the aging process. It is
unknown whether DNMT1 is also involved in replicating methylation patterns during
DNA repair,but this is likely since evidence for an early accumulation of this enzyme (but
not the de novo DNA methyltransferases) at sites of DNA damage has been obtained384.
The observed incremental methylation of CpG islands with age of human colon385 could
be due to aberrant de novo methylation.
4.3.7 PRE- AND POST-GENOME MAINTENANCE
Naturally, systems for the prevention of DNA damage or the mitigation of its adverse
effects are critically important parts of genome maintenance.A detailed discussion of the
full repertoire of such systems is beyond the scope of this book. Here I will only brieﬂy
discuss the main systems for preventing oxidative DNA damage as well as the physiologi-
cal buffering of the phenotypic penetrance of deleterious mutations.
4.3.7.1 Antioxidant defense
In view of their abundance as normal by-products of metabolism, ROS, such as singlet
oxygen, superoxide, peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and peroxynitrite, are considered
as probably the main source of spontaneous DNA damage386.However,ROS are also used
by many cell types in normal processes,for example,by macrophages as part of their abil-
ity to defend the body against intruding microorganisms. To prevent ROS from rising to
excessive levels,cells are equipped with a variety of antioxidant defense systems.Such sys-
tems include the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, or glutathione peroxi-
dase and a variety of dietary antioxidants. Antioxidants are compounds that protect cells
against the damaging effects of ROS. The main dietary antioxidants are vitamin E,

-carotene, and vitamin C. An imbalance between antioxidant defense and ROS results
in oxidative stress, leading to cellular damage.
Oxidative stress has been causally linked to many diseases, including cancer, atheroscle-
rosis, ischemic injury, inﬂammation, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s
138
GENOME MAINTENANCE

disease and Alzheimer’s disease. As we have seen, oxidative stress has been implicated as
the main causal factor in aging and antioxidant defense is therefore considered critically
important in longevity assurance.However,the results obtained after inactivating antioxi-
dant defense systems, such as SOD or catalase, or increasing their activity through overex-
pression of these enzymes or by supplementing antioxidants to the diet,are conﬂicting.Full
or partial inactivation of antioxidant defense systems does not generally result in premature
aging, which is in contrast to the aforementioned mice with inactivated DNA-repair sys-
tems (see also Chapter 5). Overexpression of antioxidant defense genes, such as SOD and/
or other ROS-scavenging enzymes, has been reported to increase lifespan in fruit ﬂies140,
but in the mouse there are few obvious beneﬁcial effects. Indeed, in my own laboratory we
have generated mice overexpressing both SOD1 and catalase as part of large, almost 100-
kb bacterial artiﬁcial chromosomes, providing most if not all the normal regulatory cis-
acting control elements. Whereas the activity of these enzymes was upregulated about
2-fold in all tissues analyzed387, the ﬁrst results of lifespan studies do not indicate that they
live signiﬁcantly longer (A.Richardson,personal communication).
In humans, clinical trials of antioxidant supplementation have failed to show beneﬁt
with respect to disease outcome and sometimes adverse effects were observed. However,
these results are controversial because there is evidence that plasma levels of antioxidants
are correlated with decreased disease risk388. In mice, no effect of long-term dietary sup-
plementation with antioxidants on the pathological outcome or on mean and maximum
lifespan has been observed389.
4.3.7.2 Mitigating the effects of mutations
Although in general DNA mutations are irreversible their effect can sometimes be
buffered. An example of such physiological buffering is the action of molecular chaper-
ones, such as the heat-shock protein Hsp90390,391. Hsp90 assists with the maturation of
many key regulatory proteins. Like other chaperones, Hsp90 recognizes and transiently
binds hydrophobic residues often found in incompletely folded proteins. Chaperones,
therefore, prevent improper protein interactions, which is especially important under
conditions that promote protein unfolding and aggregation, such as environmental
stress. Interestingly, this makes them critically important for aging, which has been asso-
ciated with increased aggregation of disease-related proteins,such as in Huntington’s dis-
ease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. The action of chaperones camouﬂages
the adverse effects of polymorphic variants (in the germ line) or accumulated somatic
mutations that would normally result in protein-folding defects. Hence, these protein-
quality control mechanisms act as effective genetic buffer or capacitor systems against
adverse molecular consequences of aging, such as the accumulation of somatic muta-
tions. We have already seen in Chapter 2 that overexpression of heat-shock genes
increases the lifespan of nematodes and ﬂies, which illustrates the importance of these
systems in aging.
GENOME MAINTENANCE
139

The repertoire of buffering mechanisms is surprisingly diverse and does not only
include mutations in the client protein itself, but also in other proteins as well as in gene-
regulatory regions. However, all such proteins become dependent on the chaperone and
compromising the function of the capacitor—for example, through a mutation or
increased environmental stress—would uncover the hidden mutation load. Although
Hsp90 is highly abundant and can be further induced by heat stress,it can be overwhelmed
when more and more proteins are destabilized.
4.4 Genome maintenance and aging
A key element in current theories of how we age is the accumulation of somatic damage.
The decline in the efﬁcacy of natural selection in protecting the soma after the age of ﬁrst
reproduction is the most likely ultimate cause of age-related cellular degeneration and
death. Since the ﬁrst replicators, genome maintenance has been the most important
somatic maintenance system, preventing untimely death of its individual carrier and
maintaining its genetic integrity, while simultaneously providing the variation on which
evolutionary success depends. Together, the various pathways for processing natural dam-
age to DNA and regulating information transfer provide a balance between individual sta-
bility and evolutionary diversity. The possible role of genome-maintenance systems in the
control of aging and longevity has been recognized almost since the discovery of DNA
repair. At that time, the ﬁrst somatic mutation theory of aging had already been formu-
lated by Leo Szilard392. Alterations in the genome of somatic cells and the possibility that
they are a primary causal factor in aging will be discussed extensively in the following
chapters. Here I will brieﬂy consider the role of genome maintenance in controlling the
rate and extent of such changes and its possible relationship to aging and lifespan.
4.4.1 GENOME MAINTENANCE AS A FUNCTION OF AGE
The possible decline of genome maintenance,especially DNA repair,with age and its rela-
tion to species-speciﬁc lifespan were major topics of aging research, especially during the
1970s and 1980s. Testing these hypotheses was plagued by difﬁculties encountered in
measuring DNA-repair capacity and interpreting the results obtained. From a technical
point of view it is clear that there is no easy way to obtain an integral measure for the mul-
titude of DNA-repair activities as they take place in an intact organism. Indeed, even an
assessment of one or few DNA-repair activities in a given tissue can be fraught with error.
This is simply due to the fact that we know far too little about the mechanisms of repair in
intact tissues or cells taken directly from the situation in vivo. The most reliable way of
140
GENOME MAINTENANCE

measuring the capacity of an organism to repair damage in DNA is to analyze the removal
of known lesions induced through treatment with relatively low, physiological doses of a
genotoxic agent. In my laboratory we have treated rodents with benzo(a)pyrene or 
N-acetyl-2-aminoﬂuorene and measured the removal of the main lesions from liver and
other tissues in young and old animals393,394.Whereas signiﬁcantly lower levels of removal
were observed in the old animals, the difference was only small. Similarly, we have ana-
lyzed the capacity of primary rat ﬁbroblasts, derived from young or old animals, to per-
form DNA-repair synthesis after UV irradiation. Only a very small decline in repair
synthesis in cells derived from the old animals was observed395.
More recent work has focused on the analysis of BER as a function of age,in view of the
importance of this pathway in processing oxidative DNA damage caused by ROS.ROS are
now considered as a major contributing factor to the various degenerative aspects of
aging. BER activity, measured as the ability of nuclear extracts from various tissues to
repair BER substrates,such as uracil,in synthetic duplex DNA,was found by Cabelof et al.
to signiﬁcantly decline with age in various tissues of rodents: brain, liver, spleen, and
testes396. This reduction by 50–70% in BER activity correlated with decreased levels and
activities of DNA pol
, as well as with increased spontaneous mutation frequencies.
Similar results were obtained by Intano et al., who speciﬁcally looked at germ cells, but in
a later study compared brain and liver extracts as well397. Interestingly, these workers
found that the age-related BER defect in germ-cell nuclear extracts could be restored by
the addition of AP endonuclease, suggesting that this enzyme is rate limiting rather than
DNA pol
, at least in this tissue398. These investigators have now also analyzed other BER
substrates and their results indicate an age-related decline in BER not only using G–U
mismatches as substrates,but also for abasic sites.However,they did not observe a decline
with 8-oxoG (C. Walter, personal communication). To some extent, these ﬁndings are in
conﬂict with results obtained by Imam et al.399, who observed a signiﬁcant age-related
decrease in the in vitro repair of uracil, 8-oxoG and 5-hydroxycytosine in mitochondrial
extracts from various regions of the mouse brain. However, in this study nuclear extracts
were also tested, without evidence for an age-dependent change in uracil repair399.
Using a synthetic DNA duplex with a 1–4 nucleotide gap in one of the strands, evidence
has been obtained that neuronal extracts from old rats are deﬁcient in completing gap
repair, a measure for BER, possibly due to a deﬁciency of DNA polymerase 
 and/or DNA
ligase400. Interestingly, also using synthetic DNA templates and neuronal extracts, these
same workers provided evidence for an age-related decline in NHEJ activity401.
Overall, therefore, there is evidence that NER and BER activities and possibly NHEJ
activity decline with age, albeit sometimes only marginally and with some discrepancies
between the different studies. The possible consequences of the age-related decline in BER
activity are still unclear.In all these studies BER activity was measured as glycosylase activity
in nuclear or mitochondrial extracts. It should be realized that these assays are difﬁcult to
carry out in a reliable, quantitative manner. In addition, glycosylase activities in protein
GENOME MAINTENANCE
141

extracts are not the same as BER activities in cells or in vivo. Even if these results faithfully
reﬂect BER activities in vivo,it is possible that any observed decreases reﬂect switches in the
organism’s utilization of repair pathways or other adaptations to an altered situation driven
by the consequences of the aging process.An age-related decrease in cell-proliferative activ-
ity comes to mind as a possibility,which may require less BER activity than at a young age.
Hanawalt402, Tice and Setlow403, as well as my own group404 reviewed this ﬁeld in the
1980s and early 1990s, and basically came to the conclusion that there is no evidence for a
drastic decline in DNA repair during aging. This is not surprising in view of the critical
importance of genome maintenance for the cell. It should be noted that a decline in DNA
repair is not necessary to explain an accumulation of alterations in the somatic genome.
Since by nature genome-maintenance systems are imperfect, one would expect such
alterations to accumulate. However, in the presence of declining repair activities such an
accumulation would be expected to be exponential rather than linear.
Apart from the absence of a general marker for DNA-repair capacity,it is also very difﬁcult
to interpret higher or lower levels of particular repair processes. Genome-maintenance
pathways necessarily act in the short-term interest of the cell or the individual. A high
activity of a repair pathway could be beneﬁcial for the survival of a cell population affected
by genotoxic stress. However, this may be at the cost of reduced genomic integrity, for
example, when the repair pathway is error-prone. At old age, therefore, organisms may
actually beneﬁt from somewhat reduced repair activities. Along the same lines, an easily
triggered DNA-damage response could lead to increased apoptosis rates,which may not be
a problem at early age. However, at later age, such increased genome maintenance may
cause organ dysfunction due to loss of functional cells.It is because of these considerations
that changes in DNA-repair activities are not always easy to interpret.
It is possible that DNA-repair activities decline with age as part of a more general
decline in enzymatic function. On the other hand, when it is true that aging is associated
with increased genotoxic stress one would probably expect an increase in DNA repair in
response to the increased damage. Both possibilities may actually be true, as can be illus-
trated by the apoptosis response, a major component of genome maintenance. In an
important series of experiments,Yousin Suh,then in Seoul,South Korea,ﬁrst observed an
association between the resistance of rat liver to tumor formation after treatment with the
direct-acting genotoxic agent methyl methanesulfonate and the robust apoptosis
response of this tissue405. This was in contrast to the brain, which is highly susceptible to
tumor induction by this agent, but displays a lack of apoptotic response. She then tested
the apoptotic response in liver to methyl methanesulfonate in rats at old age and found
this to be diminished406. Hence, whereas at young age the animals responded to the chal-
lenge of this mutagen with a robust apoptosis response, underscoring the importance of
this system in getting rid of heavily damaged cells to prevent cancer,at old age this defense
system was clearly not functioning well. Without treatment, however, she observed a
trend towards an increased level of apoptotic cells in liver of old rodents, which
142
GENOME MAINTENANCE

conﬁrmed earlier observations by others407. Hence, it is possible that a system becomes
both less effective at old age in responding to a challenge, but increasingly active during
aging due to increased spontaneous genotoxic stress. Subsequent ﬁndings by others of a
signiﬁcant reduction in mean apoptotic response to 
 radiation with increasing age in
human peripheral blood lymphocytes408 suggests that such a decline may be a general
phenomenon associated with the aging process in mammals.
4.4.2 DNA REPAIR IN STEM CELLS
Whereas DNA damage in somatic cells can have numerous deleterious consequences, of
which malignant transformation and cell death are the most critical, damage accumula-
tion in stem cells would severely constrain the capacity of such cells to replenish organs.
Indirect evidence, such as the increased expression levels of DNA-repair genes in stem
cells409, suggests that genome-maintenance capacity in stem cells is generally higher than
in normal somatic cells. The ﬁrst direct evidence that stem cells do have increased capabil-
ities to maintain their genome integrity comes from the laboratories of Peter Stambrook
(Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Jay Tischﬁeld (Piscataway, NJ, USA). These investigators have
been mentioned previously with regard to their discovery that LOH as a consequence of
mitotic recombination is a frequent spontaneous event in cells in vivo. Using the Hprt and
Aprt selectable marker genes as a measure for mutations (described in more detail in
Chapter 6), they compared mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts410. The results indicate a dramatically lower spontaneous mutation frequency
in the stem cells compared with the embryonic ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 4.8). Mutation frequency

in the embryonic ﬁbroblasts was similar to that in adult ﬁbroblasts or lymphocytes.
Interestingly, whereas in both cell types LOH was the predominant type of mutation,
mitotic recombination appeared to be suppressed in the stem cells. Of note, extended cul-
ture led to mutation accumulation in the ES cells, which underscores the fact that even in
these cells genome maintenance is not infallible. Whereas it is possible that in this case
mutation accumulation occurred as a consequence of the high oxygen concentration in
standard culture medium, it is likely that even under optimal conditions stem cells would
eventually lose genetic integrity. This issue is critically important for the potential of stem
cell therapy in delaying or reversing aging-related functional degeneration (see Chapter 8).
If we could know what makes stem cells superior in maintaining the integrity of their
genome then strategies could be designed to improve genome stability further.This is espe-
cially important since there are no obvious strategies to interfere in genome-maintenance
pathways. Since most forms of genome maintenance are based on enzymatic pathways,
often interconnected with other pathways or enzymatic functions, it is not easy to make
improvements simply by increasing the expression of one or few genes, which may often
lead to adverse side effects. As we have seen in a previous section, attempts to enhance the
efﬁciency of repair of endogenous damage by overexpressing in mammalian cells single
enzymatic activities, such as the MGMT-encoded O6-alkylguanine alkyl transferase, have
been partially successful. However, overexpression of some BER enzymes is detrimental
rather than beneﬁcial with respect to protection from spontaneous mutagenesis. The same
is true for other pathways,such as NER411.
A relatively simple explanation for the reduced mutation frequency in ES cells would
be an increased apoptotic response to spontaneous DNA damage. This would diminish
the chance of errors and therefore increase genome stability, albeit at the expense of the
number of surviving cells.As suggested by Stambrook, Tischﬁeld, and co-workers410, this
increased apoptosis, as well as a reduction in mitotic recombination, could be regulated
through an increased mismatch-repair activity.
Some time ago,John Cairns suggested that somatic stem cells might be protected against
the accumulation of DNA replication-induced mutations through the selective retention
of the ‘old’ template strands412. This would ensure that errors made during replication
would not stay with the stem cell but pass to the non-stem daughter cells. Experimental
evidence that such a mechanism exists has come from work by Chris Potten (Manchester,
UK) for stem cells in the gut413, and more recently from Tom Rando (Stanford, CA, USA)
for muscle satellite stem cells (T. Rando, personal communication). These investigators
used different types of label, incorporated during replication, to demonstrate the arrange-
ment of sister chromatids in these cells through successive divisions.
Obviously, template retention as a strategy to avoid mutations in stem cells can only
work when cells are prevented from using DNA-repair mechanisms based on recombina-
tion, because this would involve the mixing of old and new strands.We have already seen
that mouse ES cells display dramatically lower rates of mitotic recombination, possibly
144
GENOME MAINTENANCE

due to increased mismatch-repair activities. In turn this could explain the much higher
sensitivities of stem cells to DNA damage, which readily results in apoptosis414.
Whereas it is therefore possible that embryonic and adult stem cells (as well as germ
cells) are better equipped to maintain the integrity of their genome,this is not a guarantee
for indeﬁnite stability. Indeed, as we will see in the next chapter genome alterations in
such cells do occur and their frequency may increase with age. This brings us to the next
question in this section: is there any evidence that variations in the efﬁcacy of genome-
maintenance systems are related to the lifespan of a species?
4.4.3 GENOME MAINTENANCE AND SPECIES-SPECIFIC 
LIFESPAN
Apart from investigating the possibility that DNA-repair systems decline in effectiveness
at old age, thereby promoting age-related genome alterations, workers in the ﬁeld of
aging have explored the possibility that genome-maintenance capacity has been a critical
factor in the evolution of species-speciﬁc maximum lifespan. Genetic factors must
underlie the sizable differences in maximum lifespan between species (see also Chapter
2). The rapid evolutionary changes that have led to a dramatic increase in longevity
during the evolution of primates have sometimes been considered as evidence that maxi-
mum lifespan must be controlled by a small number of genes184.Indeed,there has been an
increase in maximum lifespan of about 2-fold between humans and chimpanzees since
our last common ancestor, about 5 million years ago. This period was considered too
short to account for changes in many genes at the known rate of DNA-sequence change.
This seems a reasonable argument, since a comparison of the recently completed genome
sequence of the chimpanzee with that of humans quickly indicates that they are about
99% identical415. In general, there is only about a 1.2% nucleotide difference between
humans and chimpanzees. However, I already mentioned the long-known, dramatic
karyotypic differences even between closely related mammals, and more detailed com-
parison between the genomes of human and chimpanzee indicated signiﬁcant structural
variation, involving as much as 90 Mb of insertions and deletions and approximately 35
million single-nucleotide changes416. Many of these differences will affect regulatory ele-
ments.Whereas a substantial amount of this variation may reﬂect random genetic drift,it
seems premature to assume that the adaptive evolution since the divergence of humans
and chimpanzees could not have affected a substantial number of different genes and
gene families. Hence, whereas it is possible that longevity in all mammals is controlled by
one or a few of the same gene families, this cannot be derived from a perceived small
number of genetic differences due to a short period of evolutionary time. More detailed
functional analysis of completely sequenced genomes of closely related animals may
ultimately offer the key to resolving this issue.
GENOME MAINTENANCE
145

The assumption that longevity-assurance genes as they came to be called might be few,
and possibly restricted to some basic cellular defense mechanisms, almost immediately
focused attention on DNA repair as one of several likely candidates for universal lifespan
control. This prediction was intimately linked to the theory that aging is caused by the
adverse effects of accumulating genome alterations, which are suppressed by genome-
maintenance systems. We have already seen that the correlation originally found by Hart
and Setlow between the amount of UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in skin
ﬁbroblasts and the maximum lifespan of seven different species has become difﬁcult to
interpret because of the inability of rodent cells to induce DDB2,which is essential for the
repair of UV-induced CPDs and possibly other lesions.Whereas the possibility cannot be
excluded that this deﬁciency has more to do with such animals being nocturnal than with
their short lifespan, the fact remains that through DDB humans have an improved NER
as compared with short-lived rodent cells. It remains to be seen whether other NER
proteins also differ in inducibility or basal expression levels between cells and tissues
among species with different lifespan. Apart from the previously mentioned correlation
between PARP activity and species-speciﬁc lifespan there has been continuous interest in
potential differences between short-lived rodents, still our favorite model system for
aging and human disease, and humans with respect to genome maintenance and genome
instability. In this respect, there are a number of intriguing differences related to control
of DNA damage.
As mentioned earlier in this chapter,rodent cells express much higher levels of PARP or
DNA-PK than human cells, lack p53 induction of DDB2, and do not have the same strict
control mechanisms as human cells for inducing DNA repair and other stress-response
systems upon DNA damage. And as we have seen, rodent cells lack a strict telomere
barrier against cell immortalization. Such lower stringency of DNA-damage control
might lead to an increased mutation load in cells and tissues of short-lived as compared to
long-lived organisms.
Other evidence suggesting that longer-lived species do have superior genome-maintenance
systems as compared to shorter-lived species can be derived from the varying rates of
mammalian DNA sequence evolution. For example, the rate of sequence change in the
germ line along evolutionary lineages, as determined from comparisons of mitochondr-
ial and nuclear genes,is quicker in rodents than in artiodactyls (hoofed mammals),which
is faster than in primates. Interestingly, in what is called the hominid slowdown, lineage-
speciﬁc rates in primate evolution decline from apes to monkeys and humans, with
humans (with the longest lifespan) having evolved the slowest. Whereas it has been
suggested that these differences in rates of molecular evolution are due to differences in
DNA-repair efﬁciency, it should be realized that also in this case mere correlations will
not conclusively demonstrate deﬁcient DNA repair in short-lived species. This can only
be derived by comparing cells from long- and short-lived species directly for their capac-
ity to maintain both genome integrity and viability upon genotoxic stress.
146
GENOME MAINTENANCE

Mouse cells, for example T cells from the spleen, appeared to have a similar sponta-
neous mutation frequency in vivo as human T cells, as indicated by studies examining
chromosomal aberrations or mutations at the Hprt locus, although such results are often
difﬁcult to interpret due to extensive inter-laboratory variation (see Chapter 6 for a more
detailed discussion). Both species also accumulate mutations in these cells during aging
at about the same rate. Therefore, on a chronological time scale, mice accumulate muta-
tions during aging at a much faster pace than humans do; that is, over a period of about 3
years instead of 100 years.It is possible that this difference reﬂects a much higher quality of
genome maintenance in human cells.
In principle one could examine mouse and human primary cells in culture, side by
side, for their resistance to spontaneous or induced genome alterations over longer
periods of time. To my knowledge, such experiments have never been done. A fair
comparison would be difﬁcult in view of the different behavior of mouse and human cells
in culture which may involve not only different genome-maintenance capacities but also
distinct ways in which genome-maintenance pathways are utilized. One important
difference that makes it highly likely that primary cells from short-lived rodents have an
inferior genome-maintenance machinery is the much higher probability of a mouse cell
becoming neoplastically transformed than a human cell. This is clear in the intact
organism,with tumors arising much earlier,on a chronological time scale,in mice than in
humans. Similar to the increase in the number of genome alterations with age, increased
tumor incidence in mice and humans is a function of biological age and displays an
identical pattern (although the types of tumor differ). This again would point towards
better genome-maintenance systems in humans, since DNA mutational alteration is
generally considered as the main causal factor in cancer. However, other factors that
might contribute to this increased likelihood of mouse cells becoming cancer cells in vivo
cannot be ruled out. For cultured cells the situation may be easier to interpret.
In 1963, George Todaro and Howard Green published a paper in the Journal of Cell
Biology that would become very inﬂuential417.At the time,it was well known how to bring
human ﬁbroblasts into culture and 2 years earlier Hayﬂick and Moorhead had published
their landmark paper describing the ﬁnite lifespan of human ﬁbroblasts in vitro418.
Todaro and Green described the behavior of mouse cells, which when placed in culture
appeared to be very different from human cells. They obtained their cells from mouse
embryos and demonstrated that proliferation of such cells depended on the inoculation
density.At low density cells could multiply through several transfers,but after about eight
generations lost the ability to divide, somewhat similar to Hayﬂick and Moorhead’s ﬁnite
lifespan of human cells, albeit at a much quicker pace. At higher densities, however,
mouse cells showed a much slower rate of proliferation decline. These populations
quickly overcame the dip in proliferation rate and established themselves as immortal cell
lines, most of which harbored a mutation in at least one p53 allele. This indicates that
spontaneous mutations readily accumulate in such cells419.
GENOME MAINTENANCE
147

Spontaneous immortalization never occurs in primary populations of human cells.
Such cells always become senescent, which is essentially an irreversible process due to
telomere attrition (see above). The process of establishment of mouse cells in culture is
accompanied by changes in their karyotype. Already in an early stage tetraploid cells
arise, which start dominating the culture when this has become a permanent cell line.At
that time, abnormal chromosomes start to appear, a sign of genomic instability.
Although primary human ﬁbroblasts occasionally also undergo karyotypic changes420,
their level of genomic instability is very low as compared to mouse cells established in
culture.
Whereas it is tempting to conclude from the above that mouse cells are both less viable
in culture and easily transformable, due to a lower capacity to repair damage in their
DNA, the question is where this damage comes from. As already mentioned, mouse cells
have very long telomeres and in contrast to human cells their telomerase activity in
culture is not repressed.Hence,what causes mouse cells in culture to show all the outward
signs of senescence as early as after eight population doublings, followed by immortaliza-
tion and transformation, whereas human cells can easily double their population 60
times before their telomeres become so short that a senescence response is induced, with-
out ever undergoing spontaneous immortalization? This issue has been resolved by a
series of experiments in the laboratory of Judy Campisi.In the recent past,all cells used to
be cultured under atmospheric oxygen, which is about 20%. This is much higher than
what cells under physiological conditions experience, which is not much higher than
about 3%. Campisi realized that mouse cells might not be able to sustain the increased
DNA damage resulting from such high levels of oxygen. The results of her experiments353
clearly indicated that only mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts, cultured at 20% oxygen, under-
went the reduction in proliferation originally described by Todaro and Green. At 3%
oxygen senescence was not observed and it is likely that these cells gradually developed
into immortal cell lines similar to mouse cells cultured at high density. High density
might increase viability and proliferative activity by increased production and secretion
of growth and survival factors. Indeed, in my own laboratory we compared rat skin
ﬁbroblasts and cultured them at high or low density. Whereas the cells at high density
showed no signs of proliferation inhibition,the cells at low density underwent senescence
very rapidly277.
All together, these results indicate that rodent cells are highly susceptible to culture
conditions with cell density and oxygen concentration identiﬁed as key determinants
of cell fate. Whereas it is not exactly known how cell density determines whether or not
cells become senescent or established as immortal cell lines, the role of oxygen appears
to be more straightforward. Oxygen is a major source of DNA damage, which likely
activates a senescence response, similar to what has also been observed in normal human
ﬁbroblasts treated with ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide. In such cases, telomere
148
GENOME MAINTENANCE

attrition is unnecessary to cause human cells to senesce. It is now apparent that many
forms of stress can induce a senescence response421. For example, normal cells senesce
when they overexpress certain oncogenes, such as activated components of the Ras-Raf-
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK) signaling cascade, after telomere uncapping (as distinct from attrition)
through the inhibition of TRF2,or in response to epigenetic changes to chromatin organ-
ization. This strongly indicates that senescence is a response to DNA damage threatening
to overwhelm the DNA-repair machinery. This response is mediated by the p53 pathway,
with the p16/RB pathway also playing an as yet incompletely understood role.
The fact that mouse cells respond so much more readily to such damage than human
cells is likely to be yet another indication of their relative inferiority with respect to the
quality of their genome-maintenance systems422. This is in keeping with observations
made in the Campisi laboratory of mouse ﬁbroblasts accumulating far more oxidative
DNA damage than human cells (signiﬁcantly reduced by culturing cells at 3% oxygen)
and results obtained by Pankaj Kapahi (Novato, CA, USA) that mouse and rat cells are
much more sensitive to a variety of agents producing oxidative stress423.
4.4.4 SUMMARY
In summary, whereas striking reductions in genome-maintenance capacity in mam-
malian cells or tissues at old age are not supported by the evidence, modest declines in
repair activities have been found, both in the repair of DNA adducts and in enzymatic
steps that may reﬂect the activity of core pathways. Still uncertain are the effects of such
changes on genome integrity and cell viability of the organism during its lifespan.In prin-
ciple, decreasing DNA-repair activities could lead to an exponential increase of genome
alterations with age. However, it is also possible that requirements for DNA-damage pro-
cessing alter with age. For example, a decline in cell-proliferative activity may reduce the
utilization of certain repair pathways. On the other hand, an increase in DNA-damage
production or a decrease in antioxidant defense systems would require increased DNA-
repair activities. Not enough solid data on the activity patterns of the various genome-
maintenance systems as a function of age are available for general conclusions to be
drawn. Indeed, our knowledge of genome-maintenance activities as they take place in
different organs and tissues is far too limited to allow any conclusions as to the potential
relevance of age-related alterations.
Also incompletely understood is the relationship of genome maintenance with lifespan.
Whereas direct evidence has been slow to emerge and side-by-side comparisons of cells
in culture are still sparse, it is likely that a long-lived species, such as humans, has a greater
capacity to maintain its genome than a short-lived species, such as mice. A general
GENOME MAINTENANCE
149

relationship of genome-maintenance proﬁciency with species lifespan would indicate a
causal role of genome alterations in age-related cellular degeneration and death. However,
very limited information is presently available.What has recently become a major topic of
research is the effect on lifespan of heritable mutations that inactivate or weaken speciﬁc
genome-maintenance pathways.This will be discussed in the next chapter.

Genome instability and 
accelerated aging
Aging remains poorly deﬁned at the mechanistic level. This is true in spite of the spectac-
ular progress that has been made in recent years by studying genetic mutations altering
lifespan and the onset of age-related characteristics. As we have seen in Chapter 2, these
studies have revealed that over a range of model organisms, from yeast to nematodes and
fruit ﬂies, all the way up to mice, mutations downregulating activities of growth, repro-
duction, energy metabolism, or nutrient sensing signiﬁcantly increase longevity. It is
possible that the beneﬁcial effects of reducing these activities, which have thus far been
exclusively observed in laboratory populations, stem from a decrease in the generation
of somatic damage and/or the upregulation of mechanisms that protect against such
damage. This would be in keeping with current theories of aging as an adverse effect of
the life-history strategies of multicellular organisms. Indeed, whereas the mechanisms
underlying age-related degeneration and death in these and other species still need to be
uncovered, a consensus as to why and how we age has begun to emerge.
Recapitulating the essence of what has already been explained in more detail in
Chapter 2, it is now generally accepted that the time-dependent decrease in ﬁtness in
most multicellular organisms is non-adaptive; that is, it is not controlled by a purposeful
genetic program similar to the control of development.Aging provides no speciﬁc advan-
tage to an individual animal and most researchers now accept that age-related degenera-
tion and death is ultimately due to the greater relative weight placed by natural selection
on early survival and reproduction than on maintaining vigor at later ages.This decline in
the force of natural selection at later ages is largely due to the scarcity of older individuals
in natural populations owing to mortality caused by extrinsic hazards. Because resources
are limited, somatic maintenance and repair are optimized to the effective lifespan of the
population,not maximized to help those fortunate enough to survive the hazards of their
environment to live a healthy life for extended periods of time. High extrinsic mortality
diminishes the chances to reproduce at later ages. Selection would then favor those geno-
types that help shift the allocation of resources to early growth and reproduction. By
contrast,low extrinsic mortality would permit reproduction at later ages,shifting the bal-
ance towards increased somatic maintenance, thereby increasing lifespan. This trade-off
in life-history strategy is known as the disposable soma theory. First proposed by
Tom Kirkwood9, this theory not only provides a rationale for why we age, but also

predicts the nature of its proximate cause: the accumulation of unrepaired somatic
damage. This theory, which is now supported by a large body of evidence, also explains
the similarities in symptoms of aging, both within and across species, and the apparent
universality of genetic pathways of life extension across different phyla. Indeed, rather
than being programmed to age, animals are programmed to survive long enough to
reproduce, possibly by using highly conserved cellular defense systems against somatic
damage common to all or most species. Such damage may come from the environment,
for example radiation or infectious agents,but also from inside the organism,for example
normal by-products of metabolism.
Somewhat paradoxically, the focus in the science of aging is now more on the mecha-
nisms that help to delay aging and extend lifespan than on aging itself as a complex
phenotype. Indeed, it is often argued that extension of lifespan postponing all known
markers of the aging process is the only acceptable way to study how we grow old.
However, this concept is of doubtful validity in the face of a lack of model systems that
can help us to better understand aging phenotypes, how they come about and how they
interact with each other and with genetic and environmental factors. An approach based
solely on animal models of extended lifespan is especially problematic since all of them
are inbred laboratory strains, with the possibility that they represent artifacts difﬁcult
to rule out (see Chapter 2). Hence, it is far from certain that the information obtained
will ever translate into practical interventions to prevent, ameliorate, or treat human
aging. It is also counter to established practice of creating disease models by exaggerating
its phenotypes, for example, through genetic manipulation or chemical treatment. In
fact, based on the almost general consensus that aging is caused by the accumulation of
unrepaired somatic damage, it seems relatively straightforward to generate models for
aging based on the inactivation or weakening of somatic maintenance systems. Such
models exist and they are almost all based on human and mouse mutants harboring
defects in genome maintenance. In this chapter I will discuss such models, their molecu-
lar basis, the possible nature of the pro-aging processes underlying the phenotypes
observed and their validity in representing genuine aging processes as they take place in
normal animals.
5.1 Premature aging
The ﬁrst models for accelerated aging were natural human mutants.This is not surprising
in view of the century of clinical observations on subjects of our species. Thanks to this
enormous reservoir of knowledge clinical practicioners recognized over 100 years ago
accelerated aging in a number of people suffering from life-shortening genetic defects424.
These so-called segmental progeroid syndromes,characterized by the premature appearance
152
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

of multiple signs of normal aging, were described by the medical community well before
the discovery of DNA and are therefore not biased towards a DNA-based hypothesis of
aging. So it is remarkable that so many of these syndromes are caused by a defect in
genome maintenance. Table 5.1 lists the best-known human segmental progeroid syn-
dromes, which we met when discussing genome maintenance in Chapter 4. At the top of
the list are Werner syndrome425 and Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS)426.
Werner syndrome is caused by a defect in a gene that is a member of the RecQ helicase
family427. The affected gene, WRN, encodes a RecQ homolog whose precise biological
function remains elusive, but is important for DNA transactions, probably including
recombination, replication, and repair (Chapter 4).
HGPS is caused by a defect in the gene LMNA, which through alternative splicing
encodes both nuclear lamins A and C428. Nuclear lamins play a role in maintaining chro-
matin organization (Chapter 3). Less striking segmental progeroid syndromes include
ataxia telangiectasia, caused by a heritable mutation of the gene ATM, a relay system con-
veying DNA-damage signals to effectors429, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystro-
phy,diseases based on defects in DNA repair and transcription430,and Rothmund–Thomson
syndrome, like Werner syndrome based on a heritable mutation in a RecQ gene431. There
is evidence that each of these genes, when defective, can also lead to aging symptoms in
the mouse, sometimes in combination with other gene defects432 (see also below).
The discovery that human segmental progeroid syndromes are almost without excep-
tion based on heritable defects in genome maintenance is unlikely to be a coincidence.
Indeed, there is no other gene family associated with accelerated aging. It seems therefore
logical to consider this as support for the idea that genome instability is a major cause
of aging. As we have seen, the disposable soma theory predicts that aging is caused by
the accumulation of unrepaired somatic damage55. The fact that defects in genome
maintenance lead to premature aging, but not or much less so defects in other somatic

maintenance systems, strongly suggests that DNA damage is the most important type of
age-accumulated damage and is a likely cause of many aging-related phenotypes. This
would be in keeping with the unique role of the DNA of the genome in transferring
genetic information from cell to cell and from generation to generation and its lack of a
back-up template. This is in contrast to proteins, which, at least in principle, can be easily
replaced by using the corresponding gene as a template. Indeed, the maintenance of
genomic DNA is of crucial importance to survival because its alteration by mutation is
essentially irreversible and has the potential to affect all downstream processes. The
rationale for adopting genome-maintenance mutants as models for studying aging is
therefore strong.
Because humans are often unsuitable experimental models of aging a logical approach
would be to model genome-maintenance defects in the mouse. The mouse is a good
model system for studying human aging for several reasons. First, mice are positioned
close to humans on the evolutionary scale. Second, their relatively short lifespan and
small size permits extensive lifespan studies on an economic basis. Third, mouse genetics
has closely emulated the progress in human genetics and is now almost equally powerful.
Fourth, although in mice a full phenotypic characterization of aging is still far from the
systematic catalog of signs and symptoms of old age presently available for humans, the
species ranks a solid second, with rapid improvements underway. Indeed, in the wake of
the current explosion in genetically engineered mouse models, major coordinated efforts
have emerged to obtain standardized and comprehensive databases for morphologic,
biochemical,physiologic,and behavioral characteristics of various mouse strains (e.g.the
mouse phenome project; www.jax.org/phenome). More recently, patterns of age-related
pathology of the mouse have been made computationally accessible using ontologies or
controlled vocabularies of terms (see Chapter 1). Brent Calder, in my own laboratory, has
designed an ontology for studying phenotypes in the aging mouse in the context of other
clinical, biochemical, and molecular variables. He called this system MPHASYS for
Mouse Phenotype Analysis System, which represents an integrated platform for studying
the systems biology of aging (http://mphasys.info). Such progress greatly facilitates the
development and use of mouse models of accelerated aging.
Before I discuss the validity of accelerated aging as a phenotype in the mouse, the ﬁrst
mouse model of premature aging, the so-called senescence-accelerated mouse, or SAM
for short, deserves some attention. SAM mice are a collection of ill-deﬁned mouse lines
derived from the notoriously short-lived AKR/J mice433. Much of the criticisms that have
been raised with regard to the SAM model apply to all models of accelerated aging; that
early diseases, unrelated to basic mechanisms of aging, also lead to a reduced lifespan434.
Such diseases typify genetically inbred mouse strains, which have been selected for early
fertility and growth. This issue will be discussed below. More importantly for this discus-
sion, because the genetic factors that lead to premature aging in the SAM model are
not deﬁned, the model does not point us towards a potential cause of normative aging,

which is in contrast to models based on genome-maintenance defects. Of note, an approx.
5-fold increase in mutation rate at the locus encoding hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-
transferase (Hprt; a measure for genomic instability; see Chapter 6) was observed in SAM
mice up until 6 months, compared with control animals over the same age range435. The
increased mutation frequency paralleled the phenotypic features of aging in this SAM
line, which also develop around this time. It is not impossible, therefore, that relative
defects in genome maintenance also underlie premature aging in SAM mice.
5.2 Validity of accelerated-aging phenotypes
Aging exceeds all human diseases in complexity and is the only example of generalized
biological dysfunction. Its effects become manifest in all organs and tissues, it inﬂuences
an organism’s entire physiology,impacts function at all levels,and increases susceptibility
to all major chronic diseases. Nevertheless, typical symptoms of aging, often similar
across species, can and have been deﬁned.
Mouse models of accelerated aging have been criticized in the past based on the argu-
ment that many of the degenerative phenotypes associated with aging could result from a
variety of interventions and need not necessarily involve the same causes that underlie
natural aging.Whereas this is a valid argument,it should be realized that the use of model
systems to study natural phenomena is a generally accepted approach in biology. For
example, human cancer has been studied extensively using laboratory rodents subjected
to treatment with a variety of genotoxic agents.Whereas we were all well aware of the fact
that natural human cancers were normally not caused by such treatments, this approach
nevertheless allows us to obtain valuable information about the etiology of this disease.
Of note, rodent models for studying human cancer are based on the rationale that cancer
is caused by DNA damage, hence the use of DNA-damaging agents to generate these
model systems. Nevertheless, many if not most of the early cancer models would fail a
simple validation, with morphological attributes of the model not matching those of the
human disease.Likewise,models of accelerated aging suffer from this problem,which can
be addressed by more careful modeling based on increased information on the etiology of
the adverse phenotype and the pathways affected. For example, the most recent series of
mouse models for human cancer has been greatly improved, based on highly speciﬁc
genetic alterations, known to increase human susceptibility to cancer436.
Although in both humans and mice cancer incidence increases exponentially with age,
the tumor spectrum in the two species differs signiﬁcantly, with sarcomas and lym-
phomas predominant in the mouse and epithelial cancers predominant in older
humans437. Likewise, the spectrum of non-cancer, degenerative age changes in mice and
humans is not exactly the same, which always needs to be kept in mind when using these
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING
155

models438. Moreover, whereas cancer as a phenotype is generally undisputed, aging has
also more diffuse degenerative characteristics. For humans the degenerative and disease-
related characteristics of the aging process are best described in textbooks of pathology
or geriatrics, such as Robbin’s Basic Pathology (Saunders, 2004) and Principles and
Practice of Geriatric Medicine (Wiley, 2006). For rodents there are a number of useful
papers, chapters and edited books439–442 (see also our own mouse pathology ontology;
http://mphasys.info). As far as I know there is no literature on global comparisons of
aging phenotypes in humans and mice. This would also be difﬁcult in view of the wide
variety of laboratory strains, each with its own unique genetic background.
Progeroid genotypes are associated with an early onset of some,but not all,characteris-
tics of senescence and must therefore be interpreted with caution. Together with my col-
league, Paul Hasty (San Antonio, TX, USA), I formulated the following loose criteria that
help to identify genuine mouse mutants of accelerated aging: (1) the phenotype should
present after development and maturation are complete; (2) the phenotype should be
demonstrable in control populations at a more or less similar point in their survival
curve; and (3) the genetic alteration should accelerate multiple aging phenotypes438.
None of these criteria is written in stone. Indeed, accelerated aging can occur even before
development is complete, as in the case of HGPS. Such cases, however, are more difﬁcult
to recognize as authentic models of aging, and may not be as valid as those that exhibit
aging phenotypes after maturation. It is also easily imaginable that a genetic alteration
accelerates certain symptoms of aging much more than expected on the basis of biologi-
cal age; that is, the point of occurrence on the survival curve is earlier and/or the symp-
tom is more severe. Such so-called exaggerated aging would be expected if, rather than a
quantitative, chronological masterswitch, the mutation would affect only one critical
pathway for somatic maintenance leading to severe imbalance of the survival network.
In Chapter 2 I mentioned that the single-gene mutations that increase lifespan of
worms, ﬂies, and mice may do so through the upregulation of cellular defense systems,
including DNA repair and antioxidant defense. Genes implicated in the control of such
survival responses are those belonging to the FOXO and SIRT families, which have been
demonstrated in nematodes and fruit ﬂies to control downstream targets of the pro-
longevity mutations affecting energy metabolism, nutrient sensing, reproduction, or
growth443. Downregulation of these effector genes could then conceivably lead to an
acceleration of all possible aging phenotypes. In mammals, the FOXO genes are diverse,
and knocking them out in the mouse has not revealed overt premature aging phenotypes,
possibly with the exception of Foxo3a-null female mice, which showed age-dependent
infertility and abnormal ovarian follicular development444,445.Likewise,of the seven SIRT
homologs there is not much evidence that their inactivation leads to premature aging.
Mice with inactivated SIRT1, the most closely related to the yeast Sir2 gene, were small,
exhibited developmental defects, and showed only infrequent survival in the postnatal
period446. More recently, ablation in the mouse germ line of another Sir2 homolog,
156
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

SIRT6, was shown to cause abnormalities—after only 3 weeks—that resemble some
aspects of aging, such as thinning of the skin due to loss of subcutaneous fat and signs of
osteoporosis447. However, the premature aging phenotype in these mice was not wholly
convincing. Interestingly, cells from these mice suffered from impaired proliferation and
increased genomic instability,possibly as a consequence of a defect in BER,which thus far
has never been associated with accelerated aging.
Hence, neither FOXO- nor SIRT-knockout mice display a convincing premature aging
phenotype, which might have been expected if these genes truly are master regulators of
cellular defense and stress responses. It is of course possible that a progeroid phenotype
will become visible by downregulating rather than completely ablating the activity of
these genes.
As discussed in Chapter 2,the mutations that lead to increased longevity in nematodes,
ﬂies, or mice are likely to do so only at the cost of some selective disadvantage, sometimes
already under laboratory conditions122,123. For some of the mouse longevity mutants,
such as the growth hormone deﬁcient Ames dwarf mice, ﬁtness costs are readily apparent
in the form of infertility and hypothyroidism448. However, for another long-lived mouse
mutant discussed in Chapter 2, the p66SHC mutant, initially no selective disadvantage was
obvious449. We now know that these mice are more susceptible to cold and are therefore
not likely to survive in the wild for very long (P. Pelicci, personal communication).
Another possible disadvantage in the wild would paradoxically be the loss of its free-
radical-generating capability.Indeed,p66SHC functions to increase cellular ROS to initiate
cellular destruction as part of our defense system against infectious agents. This potential
disadvantage would be masked in the p66SHC-mutant mice because they are housed in a
pathogen-free environment. Hence, whereas it is often assumed that long-lived mutants
have no price to pay, this is unlikely to be the case. Apart from the phenotypes only
manifest in the wild, we also lack the detailed phenotypic comparisons to know whether
longevity-conferring mutations do so by retarding all possible symptoms of aging
equally. In fact, the relationship between symptoms of aging and longevity is often
unclear. Therefore, long-lived mutants are also likely to have a segmentally rather than a
comprehensively delayed aging phenotype. Hence, based on what we now know of the
phenotypes of mouse models of accelerated and delayed aging, the concept of master
regulator genes to control the rate of aging is doubtful.
Based on the above, generating animal models for human aging through genetic
manipulation or pharmacological intervention based on our increased knowledge of
what causes human aging seems a valid approach. However, there are certain caveats. The
ﬁrst one involves the lack of mouse models recapitulating all possible aging symptoms in
an accelerated fashion. One could argue that only gene defects that accelerate all possible
symptoms of normal aging are likely to truly intervene in its core mechanisms. I have
already argued that this is unlikely, not only for models of accelerated aging but also for
models of delayed aging.At any rate,it is difﬁcult to ensure whether a mutant animal does
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING
157

or does not display a full complement of aging characteristics as compared with their
littermate controls. First of all, in a typical population of humans or mice, there is not a
single individual displaying all possible symptoms of aging. Whereas it is indeed very
likely that human progeroid disorders are in fact segmental424, the number of patients is
often too small to exclude the possibility that other aging-related phenotypes are also
accelerated.In mice,the situation is seriously confounded by the use of inbred strains and
the variation in genetic background. It is very well possible that a particular phenotype
that is associated with normal aging in one genetic background is not observed in others.
However, as mentioned above, the expectation of mutants accelerating or decelerating all
aspects of normal aging is probably unrealistic. I have already alluded to the lack of evi-
dence for pacemaker genes orchestrating all the critical aspects of the fundamental mech-
anisms of normal aging. Because of its very nature as a byproduct of evolution, the
postmaturational changes considered as aging are ill-deﬁned, with major confounders in
the form of genetic, environmental, and stochastic variation. It seems highly unlikely that
the many different individual phenotypes of aging, which may be related and/or interact
with each other,are controlled by one or few genes.Therefore,it is not to be expected that
single-gene mutations accelerate all aging symptoms characteristic for the normal popu-
lation. Indeed, if DNA damage is the single most important cause of aging, the hundreds
of genes directly involved in its metabolism immediately refute the possibility of a simple
genetic control center specifying each and every aging-related phenotype. Mutations in
only one of these genes may cause one or a few aging symptoms, but will never accelerate
all possible signs of aging that are characteristic for the population under study.
On the other hand, we are confronted with the fact that for the long-lived worm, ﬂy,
and mouse mutants there is abundant evidence that multiple cellular defense systems can
be upregulated in concert, to increase stress resistance and survival in a diverse range of
organisms52. Whereas we do not know whether increased survival is controlled in the
same way, by the same mechanism, in all these mutants in different species, it is possible
that in some way they all reﬂect the selective advantage of temporarily delaying reproduc-
tion and maximizing survival in times of famine, awaiting better times. As mentioned
above, there is no evidence that the gene families that potentially control these responses,
FOXO/daf-16 and SIRT/Sir2, serve as master regulators, since when inactivated they do
not produce accelerated aging phenotypes. There is also not much evidence that an
increase in the signaling pathways inhibited by the longevity mutations,such as the IGF-1
axis, leads to accelerated aging. Growth hormone-overexpressing mice have been found
associated with at least some symptoms of accelerated aging,but the overall picture is not
convincing450. A more intriguing example is the gene KLOTHO. Overexpression of this
gene in mice extends lifespan,possibly because the Klotho protein functions as a circulat-
ing hormone that binds to a cell-surface receptor and represses intracellular signals of
insulin and IGF-1451. Inactivation of the KLOTHO gene in the mouse germ line had pre-
viously been found to result in multiple symptoms of human aging after 3–4 weeks,
which could therefore be ascribed to the upregulation of the IGF-1 axis.Whereas,therefore,
158
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

the possibility cannot be excluded that premature aging phenotypes can be obtained by
promoting rather than opposing activities related to growth, reproduction, energy
metabolism, and nutrient sensing, much more convincing patterns of premature aging
can be found on the basis of mutations in genome-maintenance pathways.As we shall see,
such mutants are so widespread that it is logical to conclude that DNA damage is a major
proximate cause of aging and that only direct interference at that level uncovers acceler-
ated aging phenotypes (see below). Any upstream interference would probably have too
many side effects or require a much more sophisticated type of genetic engineering than
we currently have available.
A second caveat in using mouse models of accelerated aging is the potential misinter-
pretation of a life-shortening effect of early diseases as a sign of the acceleration of fun-
damental mechanisms of normal aging. It is often argued that mouse models with a
mutation that accelerates aging are simply showing some disease that has nothing to do
with normal aging. Based on the aforementioned evolutionary basis of aging one could
say that all genetic variations that exclusively manifest after the age of ﬁrst reproduction
are by deﬁnition part of the aging phenotype. How likely is it that a random germ-line
change would give rise to a phenotype that can superﬁcially be diagnosed as aging; that is,
adversely affects postmaturation ﬁtness? The ﬁrst results of mouse ethyl nitrosourea
mutagenesis programs, in which the effects of many different randomly induced germ-
line mutations are assessed, suggest that aging phenotypes are rare. The phenotypes
observed in ethyl nitrosourea mutagenesis screens are to a large extent developmental and
very few if any have been deﬁned as aging-related452. In addition, very few mouse knock-
outs exhibit aging phenotypes. Thus, genetic alterations rarely impact aging. In view of
the convincing array of aging phenotypes in the genome-maintenance mutants dis-
cussed, the point is probably moot, but it remains useful to point out the difference
between a disease and an aging phenotype.
Consider the well-known genetic diseases cystic ﬁbrosis and sickle cell anemia. These
genetic alterations reduce lifespan by impairing the function of a vital system independ-
ent of normal aging. The negative impact of both these diseases is apparent very early in
life and neither disease is observed in the elderly. On the other hand, atherosclerosis and
its sequelae, such as coronary and cerebrovascular disease, is an age-related disease
process. Similar examples to the one used by Williams to illustrate the effect of a
pleiotropic aging gene, promoting late-life arteriosclerosis through enhanced calcium
deposition in the bones (a selective advantage at young age)76, could be found for dia-
betes, osteoporosis, cancer, and other diseases of the aged. Although none of these dis-
eases occur exclusively in the elderly, the high incidence in this segment of the population
is compelling and it is very difﬁcult to argue that they are not genuine aging phenotypes
(see also Chapter 7). Hence, in interpreting accelerated aging symptoms it is critically
important to correctly diagnose the phenotype. On this basis it should be possible to
differentiate between genuine aging phenotypes and phenotypes related to disorders
unrelated to aging.

5.3 Genome maintenance and accelerated 
aging in mice
Embryonic stem cells and gene-targeting technologies have been instrumental in con-
ﬁrming during the last decade the general prediction that genome-maintenance systems
are critical for suppressing tumor formation283. The data show that mutation of a single
gene can increase genomic instability, leading to cancer. Of note, the cancer spectrum in
such mutants, as in human cancer hereditary syndromes, is segmental even though these
DNA-repair pathways function in many cell types that are not predisposed to cancer.
Importantly, while focused on cancer, several investigators have found that mutating
some genome-maintenance genes cause progeroid syndromes. Currently there are a
number of mouse lines harboring speciﬁc genetic alterations that present with a short-
ened lifespan and precocious aging phenotypes (for an exhaustive listing, see Lombard
et al.453). In each of these mouse models some aspect of genome maintenance is affected.
In most cases the mutation is recessive: only the homozygous mutant is affected.
However,since there are no complete lifespan studies for most heterozygotes,unless there
was clear evidence for a phenotypic effect already at young age, the possibility of subtle
gene-dose effects at old age can almost never be excluded. Below I will brieﬂy discuss the
most prominent models with some details of the aging-related phenotypes they affect
and their possible link to one or more causal factors.It should be noted that none of these
models has been subjected to standardized, objective phenotyping, and that only some of
them were compared side-by-side with littermate controls, and the genetic background
may be different from model to model, making comparisons difﬁcult.
5.3.1 AGING, DNA-EXCISION REPAIR, AND TRANSCRIPTION
A prominent type of DNA-repair defect associated with premature aging can be found at
the interface of NER and transcription. As outlined in Chapter 4, NER removes a broad
range of helix-distorting lesions and can be subdivided in two pathways differing in damage
recognition but sharing the same repair machinery: GG-NER for the removal of distorting
lesions anywhere in the genome and TC-NER for the elimination of distorting DNA dam-
age blocking transcription283. Two mouse models with defects in NER have been reported
to display premature aging symptoms. One involves a partially inactivating (hypomorph)
mutation in the Xpd gene454 and the other a knockout,or hypomorph,of the Ercc1 gene455.
In humans,a heritable mutation in the XPD gene is responsible for the disorder trichoth-
iodystrophy. Trichothiodystrophy shows no predisposition to cancer, but leads to severely
impaired physiological and neurological development, including retarded growth,
cachexia, sensorineural hearing loss, retinal degeneration, and its hallmark features of brit-
tle hair and nails, and scaly skin430. Trichothiodystrophy patients have a greatly reduced
160
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

lifespan and the disease is often considered as a segmental progeroid syndrome. The
helicase encoded by the XPD gene is one of the 10 subunits of basal transcription factor 
IIH (TFIIH), which is required for multiple processes: GG-NER, TC-NER of NER and 
non-NER lesions,as well as transcription initiation by RNA polymerases I and II.
An Xpd-deﬁcient mouse model was generated by mimicking a human mutation that
causes trichothiodystrophy456. This mutation does not ablate but rather alters the normal
activity of Xpd. These mice have impaired transcription and mildly impaired NER. These
characteristics closely resemble those of humans with the disorder, including brittle hair.
At this time, Xpd mice have been exhaustively characterized side by side with their litter-
mate controls in a similar C57BL/6 genetic background.The results indicate a host of pre-
mature aging symptoms (Table 5.2), but also a limited number of trichothiodystrophy-
speciﬁc phenotypes335.Somewhat surprisingly,lifespan of these mice was reduced only by
about 10%, in spite of the many severe premature aging symptoms335 (see also below).
Are the accelerated aging characteristics observed in the Xpd mutant mice due to defec-
tive DNA repair alone? Xpd is important for repairing DNA in association with transcrip-
tion, so the exact way in which it delays age-related decline is difﬁcult to determine.
Complete abrogation of NER, accomplished by mutating Xpa, has not yet been shown to
cause premature aging in mice318.Thus,defective NER,which leads to an accumulation of
DNA mutations, is unlikely to be the sole cause of early senescence in Xpd mutant mice.
However, defective DNA repair apparently does contribute to premature senescence in
these animals. This can be derived from the observation that a much more severe pheno-
type is obtained by crossing the Xpd mutants with an Xpa-knockout mouse. Such mice
live only for about 6 months and also express multiple symptoms of aging shortly after
birth (J. Hoeijmakers, personal communication).

It is conceivable that a response to stalled transcription at sites of DNA damage is
responsible for early aging in the Xpd mutant mice. In this scenario, a defective TFIIH
results in stalled transcription that decreases gene activity and leads to a mild accumula-
tion of DNA damage. Cells respond by undergoing apoptosis, which may cause the early
organismal senescence in these mice. Indeed, increased apoptosis and activated p53 have
been observed in liver from both young and old Xpd mutant mice (Y. Suh, personal com-
munication). In the absence of Xpa alone (that is, with a fully functional Xpd protein),
transcription from a damaged DNA template can still take place, possibly because the
amount of spontaneous damage subject to NER is low. (BER, not NER, is the main path-
way for removing the most abundant forms of spontaneous DNA damage, such as oxida-
tive lesions.) In combination with the Xpd mutation, however, the complete absence of
Xpa would exacerbate the suboptimal performance of TFIIH, leaving the DNA lesion
exposed for a greater period of time; this would result in a further decline in gene activi-
ties and an enhanced response. Thus, the premature aging symptoms in the Xpd mutant
mouse may be primarily the result of a cellular response to impaired TFIIH at the site of a
spontaneous DNA lesion, rather than the accelerated accumulation of DNA damage or
mutations. Indeed, mutation frequencies at a lacZ reporter locus in this mouse model
were not elevated as compared to control animals of the same age325.
As mentioned above, in spite of their severe symptoms of premature aging, Xpd mice
show only a modest reduction in lifespan. This may be due, at least in part, to some unex-
pected features in these mice that appear associated with caloric restriction, a condition
usually linked to retardation of age-related pathology and extension of lifespan (Chapter 2).
These features include a reduced incidence of cancer, cataract, and inﬂammation335.
Global gene-expression analysis of the liver of these mice, using microarrays, indicated
reduced IGF-1 signaling and decreased energy metabolism. This was accompanied by
reduced plasma IGF-1 levels (Y. Suh, personal communication). A reduction of IGF-1
signaling, which as we have seen is generally associated with increased lifespan, was also
found in the aforementioned SIRT6-defective mice447.The attenuation of IGF-1 signaling
in mice with DNA-repair defects may reﬂect a compensatory mechanism to limit the
onslaught of spontaneous DNA damage457. Indeed, reducing IGF-1 signaling might be a
general mechanism to cope with increased stress, including genotoxic stress, similar in
nature to the mechanism underlying increased lifespan as a consequence of dampening
IGF-1 signaling in nematodes, ﬂies, or mice (Fig. 5.1). Activation of this protective path-
way in the Xpd-defective mice could explain why these mutants live as long as they do in
spite of their severe premature aging phenotypes.
Another NER-defective mouse model showing symptoms of premature aging involves
the gene ERCC1.The ERCC1–XPF complex forms an endonuclease,which is required for
the 5' incision to remove the damage-containing oligonucleotide during NER, but is also
essential for interstrand cross-link repair.Hence,Ercc1-knockout (Ercc1/) mice are deﬁ-
cient in GG-NER, TC-NER, and interstrand cross-link repair. These mice show a severe
phenotype, including runted growth, progressive neurological abnormalities, kyphosis,
162
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

a short lifespan of about 3 weeks, and liver and kidney dysfunction455.At the cellular level
the Ercc1 defect leads to accelerated nuclear polyploidization. The combination of a
knockout allele with a truncated Ercc1 allele (Ercc1/m), resulting in a protein lacking the
last seven amino acids, delays the onset of the premature aging phenotype and extends
the maximal lifespan to about 4–6 months455. Indeed, by generating a conditional knock-
out mouse model for this gene (in which the gene can be inactivated at will at any time),
Jan Hoeijmakers and co-workers succeeded in postponing aging in these mice even fur-
ther (J. Hoeijmakers, personal communication). Similar to the Xpd mutant, the prema-
ture appearance of aging symptoms is not caused by the defect in NER (although this may
contribute), but is due mainly to the defect in the removal of the highly toxic interstrand
cross-links.In the hypomorphic Ercc1 mutant mouse an increased level of genomic insta-
bility at a lacZ reporter locus was observed at 4 months of age325. Whereas this mouse
model may ultimately appear as a valid model of accelerated aging, the fact that severe
symptoms already appear before development is complete make it less suitable as a model
for aging phenotypes that normally appear only in adult animals. However, what this
model appears to show is that the severity of the premature aging phenotype varies with
the different gradations of gene inactivation.
5.3.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF DNA DOUBLE-STRAND-BREAK
REPAIR
DSBs in DNA are highly toxic lesions that can be created through a variety of mechanisms,

mechanistically distinct DNA-repair pathways, homologous recombination (HR) or
non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)338. A key factor of DSB repair by NHEJ is the
DNA-end-binding Ku70–Ku80 heterodimer. As ﬁrst shown by Paul Hasty (San Antonio,
TX, USA), mice harboring a null mutation in the Ku80 gene have a signiﬁcantly shorter
lifespan and display a range of premature aging phenotypes458. This mouse model is one
of the few in which age-related phenotypes have been compared with those of their litter-
mate controls in a side-by-side study in an identical environment (same air, same food,
same bedding, same cage). This is extremely important because aging phenotypes in the
mouse are not necessarily the same in humans and can have different causes.In this study
a phenotype was only considered a premature aging phenotype when exactly the same
phenotype was also observed during normative aging in the wild-type littermate con-
trols. I will use this study as an example to demonstrate the validity of the premature
aging phenotype in mice with defective DNA repair.
Figure 5.2 shows the survival curve of the Ku80-mutant mice, indicating a signiﬁcantly
shorter lifespan than their littermate controls. One of the most prominent aging-related
phenotypes occurring early in the mutants is kyphosis (also called lordokyphosis),the lat-
eral curvature of the spine that is so frequently observed at old age, both in mice and
humans (Fig. 5.3). In humans the causes of kyphosis are not necessarily the same as in
mice. Kyphosis in the Ku80-mutant mice is likely due to osteoporosis because histology
showed the older mutant and control bones to exhibit osteopenia (thinning of the bone
and reduced trabeculae). Figure 5.4 shows growth-plate closure, a well known age-related
phenotype that in humans is part of maturation, not senescence. Mice are different from
humans in that growth plates do not close until well after maturation. Here, growth plates
close much earlier in Ku80-mutant mice than in control mice. Figure 5.5 illustrates skin
atrophy; a well described age-related phenotype in both mice and humans. Again, skin

atrophy was observed earlier in Ku80-mutant mice than in their littermate controls. In
addition, various other aging-related phenotypes were observed in Ku80-mutant mice,
well before they appeared in their littermate controls (forms of liver degeneration,reactive
immune responses)458. Even though these phenotypes occur earlier in Ku80-mutant mice
than in the controls,they all occur at about the same point in their biological lifespans (the
latter half of their survival curve).Despite these similarities there are also differences; most
obvious is the difference in cancer incidence. Tumor frequency at similar points on the
survival curve is much lower in Ku80-mutant mice than in their littermate controls458.

The most straightforward explanation for the accelerated aging phenotypes in 
Ku80-null mice is increased genomic instability resulting from erroneous or inefﬁcient
repair of DNA DBSs in the absence of NHEJ. Such increased genomic instability would
trigger apoptosis and interfere with normal cell growth and tissue regeneration. Whereas
increased genomic instability would be expected to promote tumor initiation, the pres-
ence of an intact p53 checkpoint is likely to suppress tumor progression through an
apoptotic or senescence response.This scenario is supported by actual observations.Ku80-
mutant mouse cells display growth impairment, increased susceptibility to apoptosis and
replicative senescence, and a marked increase in chromosomal aberrations, including
breaks, translocations, and aneuploidy350. Results from my laboratory indicate increased
genomic instability at a lacZ reporter locus in liver, and especially spleen, at just 5 months
of age (see also Chapter 7).
Hence,whereas the inability of the Ku80-mutant mouse to repair DNA damage leads to
excessive genome rearrangements, the resulting increase in cell death or dysfunction
becomes manifest as impaired proliferation and regeneration, resulting in diminished
cancer and accelerated age-related organ and tissue degeneration. This situation may be
very similar for two other mouse models with defects in DSB repair: mice with defects in
DNA-PKCS—the catalytic subunit of the Ku70–Ku80 complex—and mice harboring a
hypomorphic mutation in the BRCA1 gene, a major player in HR. In DNA-PKCS-null
mice the situation resembles the Ku80-null model: the absence of intact NHEJ promotes
genomic instability leading to impaired tissue growth and regeneration459. Complete loss
of BRCA1 is embryonically lethal and the same is true for the homozygous BRCA1 hypo-
morph, lacking exon 11. However, the homozygous hypomorph can be completely res-
cued in a p53-heterozygous background. In a p53-homozygous mutant background these
mice exhibit a high incidence of cancer. In the p53-heterozygous background BRCA1
hypomorphic mice exhibit a long list of premature aging phenotypes and a signiﬁcant
reduction of lifespan,probably caused by the activity of the remaining p53 allele,which is
triggered by genomic instability to prevent normal cell proliferation460.
Thus far, there is no evidence that inactivation of Ku80’s partner in NHEJ—Ku70—is
causing accelerated aging461. However, Ku70-null mice have never been studied as an
aging cohort over longer periods of time in parallel with their littermate controls. Such
studies are now underway and should soon reveal if there really is a difference between
the Ku80 and Ku70 mutants. It is possible that each of these two key players in DSB repair
has other, tissue-speciﬁc functions which confound their role in suppressing aging.
5.3.3 WRN, ATM, AND TELOMERES IN MICE AND HUMANS
Several mouse models of premature aging involve defects at the interface of telomere
maintenance and DNA DSB repair. The ﬁrst of these models that should be mentioned is
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING
167

the WRN-defective mouse. Whereas in most of the above cases the mouse mutants of
genome instability were generated primarily for studying cancer, the WRN gene defect
was modeled on its own account as a model of accelerated aging462,463. Human patients
with Werner syndrome prematurely exhibit signs of senescence including atrophic skin,
graying and loss of hair, osteoporosis, malignant neoplasms, diabetes, and shortened
lifespan464. Furthermore, a greatly increased frequency of genomic rearrangements has
been reported in peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients465. Mice with Wrn
deleted exhibit no obvious phenotype, suggesting redundancy with another RecQ heli-
case462,463. However, the fact that Wrn-mutant mice do not recapitulate Werner syndrome
as seen in humans does not diminish the potential importance of the human phenotype
with regard to aging or the importance of mouse models. Similar cases, in which the
mouse model failed to recapitulate the human phenotype, have been observed many
times for genes that suppress cancer in humans. After a closer look, the proteins involved
were found to perform remarkably similar biochemical functions with the same physio-
logical signiﬁcance in both species. For example, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is a
tumor suppressor that in humans prevents the formation of tumors in the retina.
However,in Rb-deﬁcient mice,retinoblastoma does not occur.Instead,adenomas develop
in the intermediate pituitary gland. However, retinoblastomas will develop in Rb mutant
mice after reducing the expression of an Rb family member, p107466. Thus, the difference
in phenotype between mouse and human is simply due to different levels of expression of
genes in the Rb family. Therefore, tumor-suppressor genes perform remarkably similar
functions in mice and humans at both the biochemical and physiological levels.
An important confounder of modeling human cancer and aging in the mouse involves
telomere instability.As we have seen in Chapters 3 and 4, telomeres are the nucleoprotein
complexes that occur at the ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes. In the mammalian
genome they consist of several kilobases of repetitive DNA sequences (TTAGGG)
that attract a number of sequence- and structure-speciﬁc binding proteins. These
chromosomal caps prevent nucleolytic degradation and provide a mechanism for cells to
distinguish natural termini from DNA DBSs, which would otherwise signal DNA dam-
age,resulting in cell-cycle arrest,senescence,or apoptosis.As we have seen,cells inevitably
lose telomeric DNA with each cell division, which can be countered by elongation mech-
anisms. The most important of these mechanisms is telomerase, a reverse transcriptase
composed of a protein component and an RNA (complementary to the telomeric single-
stranded overhang), that can synthesize telomeric DNA directly onto the ends of
chromosomes467.
Telomerase-null mice have been made by ablation of the RNA component of the
enzyme, Terc468. The enzyme is less important in mice than in humans because mice have
very long telomeres. This is thought to be the reason that mice are more prone to sarco-
mas and lymphomas whereas humans are more prone to epithelial tumors437.Indeed,late
generations (the ﬁfth to eighth generations) of telomerase-knockout mice display a more
168
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

human-like spectrum of tumors469. Progressive telomere erosion in Terc-null mice of
somewhat earlier generations has been found to be associated with premature aging
symptoms, but these represented far from a full spectrum of classical pathophysiological
symptoms of aging. In these mice, age-dependent telomere shortening and increased
genetic instability were associated with shortened lifespan as well as a reduced capacity to
respond to stresses such as wound healing and hematopoietic ablation470.
As mentioned above, the ATM gene, when defective, causes a segmental progeroid dis-
order in humans.ATM stimulates cell-cycle responses to the highly toxic DNA DSBs.One
of its targets is actually p53, which can also be activated via ATM-independent mecha-
nisms. ATM likely plays a role in telomere maintenance, possibly through direct binding
to short telomeres, phosphorylation of telomere-binding proteins, or some other form of
regulation of other telomere proteins257. Premature aging in ataxia telangiectasia is not
that obvious471 and in its mouse counterpart progeroid symptoms are even less promi-
nent472 unless they are bred into a Terc-deﬁcient background. Against the background of
eroding telomeres, the double null mice exhibited a general growth and cell-proliferation
defect, probably causing the extensive organ dysfunction observed in this mouse
model473. The cause of the problems in these mice is likely to be increased genomic insta-
bility and an elevated rate of apoptosis. This is typically observed in the Atm and Terc
mutants separately, but greatly accelerated by the combined defect. It results in dimin-
ished stem-cell reserve in several organ systems and this impairment in regenerative
capacity results in premature aging, exempliﬁed by kyphosis, reduced muscle and fat
mass, and several other aging-related phenotypes. Hence, in the combined Terc/Atm
mutants the accelerated aging phenotype is much more convincingly expressed than in
each mutant separately.
Similar to the Atm mutants, bringing the Wrn defect into a Terc-deﬁcient background
dramatically uncovered an array of premature aging phenotypes reminiscent of the
human syndrome474. After four to six generations, during which the initially long telom-
eres of these mice become progressively shorter, mice were obtained of shorter lifespan
displaying premature aging symptoms at 12–16 weeks. Symptoms included hair loss,
cataract formation, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, type II diabetes, and kyphosis, which
are all typical also for the patients with Werner syndrome. Since patients with Werner
syndrome display high levels of spontaneous genome instability in their peripheral blood
lymphocytes, bone-marrow metaphases in the late-generation double knockout mice
were examined and showed similar, marked genomic instability. Increased genomic
instability was also observed in embryonic ﬁbroblasts from these mice as well as a
reduction in their replicative lifespan. A marked increase in apoptosis rates was observed
in intestinal crypt cells. Whereas not prominently cancer-prone, the earlier-generation
Terc/ Wrn/ mice succumbed to osteosarcomas and soft-tissue sarcomas, typical for
human patients with Werner syndrome, but not for mice. The later-generation mutants
(generations 4–6) may live too short for these tumors to manifest474.
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING
169

As pointed out in Chapter 4, WRN (like ATM) plays a role in telomere maintenance,
and the conclusion could easily be drawn that the Wrn mutation mainly reinforces the
premature phenotype reported to be associated with the ablation of Terc alone.
Conceivably, in mesenchymal tissues, which are mainly affected in the Terc/Wrn double
knockouts, intact WRN is able to compensate for the lack of telomerase. It may be able to
do that through its role (like ATM) in HR, a repair process known to be involved in the
maintenance of eukaryotic telomeres475. Ultimately, the cause of the accelerated aging
phenotypes is likely to be very similar as the one discussed for the Terc/Atm-, Ku80-, and
Brca1-defective mice, namely increased genomic instability resulting in impairment of
cell proliferation.The same would probably apply to a third accessory DNA-repair-defec-
tive mouse model, the TOPIII 
-deﬁcient mouse model.
It is known that topoisomerases interact with RecQ helicases476. Even though there is
virtually no phenotype in Wrn-mutant mice, deletion of the helicase domain of Wrn
increases the frequency of spontaneous mutations in T lymphocytes and inhibits prolif-
eration of embryonic ﬁbroblasts from these mice. Both cellular phenotypes are exacer-
bated by inhibition of TOPI462. The Wrn defect also increases tumor formation in a
p53-defective background, much more than the p53 defect by itself463,477. The combined
defect also results in tumors, such as sarcomas, which do not normally develop in a p53-
null mouse model.
Because of the increased sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibition of cells from the Wrn-
defective mice (which has also been demonstrated for lymphoblastoid cells derived from
patients with Werner syndrome478), it is possible that the Wrn defect is to some extent
caused by impaired interaction with topoisomerases. This is supported by the observa-
tion that mice with a topoisomerase defect—TOPIII
-null mice—develop normally but
have a reduced lifespan and display a premature aging phenotype479.As pointed out in the
previous chapter, work with yeast suggests that the TOPIII
 phenotype is inﬂuenced by
RecQ helicase activity. It is conceivable, therefore, that ablating the TOP3B gene may
impair the RecQ family members causing the symptoms of aging, which Wrn inactiva-
tion alone, at least in the mouse, cannot accomplish.
5.3.4 NUCLEAR STRUCTURE
Attention was drawn to the importance of maintaining nuclear organization as a
longevity-assurance system once it was demonstrated that HGPS is caused by de novo
mutations in the gene LMNA, encoding both lamin A and lamin C through alternative
splicing428. A de novo mutation activates a cryptic splice site, effectively resulting in a
protein with a 50-amino-acid deletion near the C-terminus of lamin A. This deletion
allows farnesylation, but prevents proteolytic cleavage of the prelamin A to generate the
ﬁnal product. The resulting mutant lamin A acts in a dominant fashion (patients are
170
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

heterozygous) and the aberrant protein is called progerin. Whereas mouse models
accurately mimicking the human defect are now being generated in different laborato-
ries, two existing models deserve some discussion. The ﬁrst is a null mouse for the metal-
loproteinase gene Zmptse24, encoding an enzyme involved in the proteolytic processing
of prelamin A. Apart from nuclear abnormalities, this model shows growth retardation,
alopecia, bone fractures, muscle weakness, and early cardiac dysfunction480. More
recently, accelerated aging in these mice has been linked to p53 signaling activation,
supporting the concept that hyperactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 may cause
accelerated aging481.
The second model was originally aimed at mimicking a mutation in LMNA that in
humans normally results in Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). (Heritable
mutations in lamin A/C or lamin-binding proteins cause various diseases other than
HGPS. For example, mutations in emerin, a lamin-binding protein, or LMNA cause
EDMD, and mutations in LMNA can also cause Dunnigan-type partial lypodystrophy.
The mutations that cause these diseases are non-overlapping and it is unclear as to how
different mutations in the same gene can cause different diseases.) The homozygous
EDMD mutation in the mouse causes death in 4–6 weeks. The mice develop severe
growth retardation and a number of other symptoms reminiscent of HGPS482. In neither
of the two mouse models has genomic instability, cell growth rate, or apoptosis rate been
studied thus far. In interpreting these results, it should be kept in mind that HGPS is an
early-onset segmental progeroid syndrome that occurs before reproductive maturation.
Hence, it is unrealistic to expect an adult-onset type of premature aging.
Is it possible to ascribe HGPS to a defect in genome maintenance? Lamins at the
nuclear periphery and throughout the nucleoplasm are thought to maintain nuclear
shape.However,they may also contribute to tissue-speciﬁc gene expression through their
role as key elements in nuclear architecture214. Regions of chromatin appear to be
anchored to the lamina and, at least in vitro, lamins have been demonstrated to bind
directly to chromatin. As pointed out in Chapter 3, the actions of a gene are not only
inﬂuenced by its position in the one-dimensional DNA sequence, relative to regulatory
elements, but also by its particular location in the nucleus. Such position effects may
inﬂuence not only transcription, but also replication, repair, and recombination. For
example, when DNA undergoes more than one DBS the spatial proximity of the broken
ends is positively correlated with the probability of illegitimate joining. Hence, it is of the
utmost importance to faithfully maintain lamin organization, defects in which are likely
to result in genomic instability. Indeed, it was recently found that Zmpste24-deﬁcient
mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts as well as cells from HGPS patients show increased DNA
damage and chromosome aberrations and are more sensitive to DNA-damaging
agents483.It is conceivable that as a consequence of the dominant progerin or unprocessed
prelamin A the distorted cell-nuclear architecture will no longer faithfully support the
proper assembly of DNA-repair foci.

5.3.5 MITOTIC-SPINDLE CHECKPOINT AND 
THE ROLE OF ANEUPLOIDY
During the process of cell division the spindle-assembly checkpoint (also called the
mitotic checkpoint; see Chapter 3) allows every chromosome to send a stop signal, pre-
venting cells from entering anaphase until each chromatid is properly attached to the
microtubules.Defects in this checkpoint provoke chromosome mis-segregation and ane-
uploidy (gain or loss of chromosomes),which can have adverse functional consequences,
including cell death and cancer. For example, defects in different components of the
mitotic checkpoint have consistently been observed in cancer cells,characterized by chro-
mosomal instability484. Recently, a mouse model was made based on partial inactivation
of the gene Bub1b, encoding a spindle-assembly checkpoint protein BubR1. These mice,
Bub1bH/H(H for hypomorph), which express BubR1 at 11% of normal levels, have a
median lifespan of only 6 months and display a host of premature aging symptoms,
including kyphosis, cataracts, thinning of the skin, reduced wound healing, infertility,
and muscle atrophy485. They develop aneuploidy (as measured in splenocytes) from the
age of 2 months onwards that increase as the mice age further. There is a strong correla-
tion between the degree and severity of the aneuploidy and the onset and progression of
the aging phenotypes. Increased apoptosis in several tissues from these animals at 1 year
of age was not found. However, senescence-associated 
-galactosidase activity was high
compared with control mice. This observation of increased cellular senescence in vivo
was further supported by an accelerated rate of senescence of embryonic ﬁbroblasts cul-
tured from these mice, which also correlated with the degree of aneuploidy observed in
these same cells. Hence, the progressive aneuploidy was assumed to be the underlying
cause of both senescence in vitro and premature aging symptoms in vivo. Interestingly,
BubR1 expression declines in tissues of normal mice with age485. Hence, it is conceivable
that increased aneuploidy, which has been observed in aging animals, contributes to
normal aging as well.
A somewhat unexpected ﬁnding in this study was the virtual lack of spontaneous
tumors in the mutants, in spite of the fact that aneuploidy is one of the hallmarks of
cancer. In this respect, it is possible that the severity of the aneuploidy, while initially
promoting the genesis of cancer cells, eventually prevents further tumor progression,
similar to the situation in the aforementioned Atm/Terc mutant mice. This could be a
direct effect of ongoing aneuploidization or the result of increased cellular responses
activated by an aneuploidy checkpoint.
More recently, the same research group reported similar results for mice haploinsufﬁ-
cient for both Bub3 and Rae1, two other genes involved in mitotic-checkpoint control in
mammals486.Living much longer than the Bub1bH/H mice,the Bub3	/ Rae1	/ mice display
similar premature aging characteristics between 15 and 27 months. Also, these mice dis-
played enhanced cellular senescence rather than apoptosis, which could be the underlying
cause of premature aging. Indeed, aneuploidy in the compound mutant mice appeared
172
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

to be higher than in the Bub1bH/H mice in spite of the much shorter lifespans of the latter.
Aneuploidy was also present in the individual Bub3- and Rae1-haploinsufﬁcient mice,
neither of which displayed signs of early aging. However, it is difﬁcult to draw any deﬁnite
conclusions in the absence of complete lifespan studies, as pointed out above, especially
since aneuploidy was only measured in splenocytes.
5.3.6 DEFECTS IN REPLICATION OF MITOCHONDRIAL DNA
Another example of a mouse model with a defect in genome maintenance especially
designed to test the hypothesis that genomic instability is involved in aging is the polgA
proofreading-deﬁcient mouse model. POLG, the catalytic core of the mtDNA poly-
merase 
 (pol
), is a mtDNA polymerase encoded in the nuclear genome. Mutations in
both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA have been demonstrated to accumulate with age in
a tissue-speciﬁc pattern487,488. Hence, in the polgA-deﬁcient mouse one would expect to
see accelerated mutation accumulation in the mitochondrial genome as well as the pre-
mature appearance of aging-related phenotypes. Both predictions turned out to be
correct. Apart from a 3-5-fold increase in mtDNA mutations in brain, heart, and liver,
and respiratory chain dysfunction in the heart, a host of premature aging symptoms was
observed in homozygous mutant animals, including osteoporosis, lordokyphosis, alope-
cia, a growth defect, reduced subcutaneous fat, hypertrophy of the heart, and anemia489.
Lifespan was reduced by about 50%. Very similar results were obtained in a somewhat
later, independent study490 with a mouse expressing another proofreading-deﬁcient
version of POLG. Interestingly, the enhanced mitochondrial mutation load in these
‘mtDNA mutator mice’ was already established at 2 months and did not dramatically
increase thereafter. This suggests that, once present, somatic mutations can continue to
exert adverse physiological effects even without any further dramatic increases.
Naturally, one would expect that the mutations and the premature aging phenotypes
arise through increased ROS production as a consequence of respiratory-chain dysfunc-
tion. In turn, this would further increase ROS production, leading to more mutations,
and so on. This is called the vicious-cycle hypothesis, which will be discussed in more
detail in the next chapter. A causal role of ROS generation and mitochondrial damage in
aging is supported by the recent demonstration in mice that overexpression of a catalase
transgene targeted to mitochondria signiﬁcantly extends lifespan (20% increase in both
average and maximum lifespan)491. However, the mtDNA mutator mice were found not
to affect ROS production and there was no evidence for increased oxidative stress.
Instead, accumulation of mtDNA mutations was found to be associated with increased
apoptosis490.
Whereas it is tempting to interpret the association between increased mtDNA muta-
tions and premature aging as observed in the polg-deﬁcient mice as strong evidence for a
causal role of mtDNA mutations in aging it should be noted that the mutation frequencies
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING
173

observed in these mice were more than an order of magnitude higher than typical levels
in aged humans. Also the pattern of affected tissues in these mice was different from
normally aged humans or mice, in which very high mtDNA mutation frequencies are
observed in muscle, heart, and brain. The types of mutation were different too, since in
normally aged tissues deletions are a major component of the spectrum (see Chapter 6).
Hence, ironically the results with the polg mouse models may argue against a causal role
of mtDNA mutations in aging, at least as far as point mutations are concerned492.
Interestingly, results obtained with transgenic mice expressing a dominant mutant vari-
ant of the mouse Twinkle protein suggest that the accumulation of deletion mutations in
the mitochondrial genome may also not be causally related to aging493. Such mutational
variants of this nuclear-encoded mitochondrial replicative helicase are known to cause
multiple mtDNA deletions (and disease) in humans and do so also in mice. These so-
called deletor mice do not show premature aging, which was interpreted to indicate that
subtle accumulation of mtDNA deletions and progressive respiratory-chain dysfunction
are not sufﬁcient to accelerate aging. Whereas muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dys-
function was observed in these mice, their lifespan was normal. Taken together, these
results suggest that mtDNA mutations, including deletions, are by themselves not
sufﬁcient to cause aging.
5.3.7 THE p53 ANTI-TUMOR RESPONSE AS A CAUSE OF AGING
By now the reader will probably have noticed that many if not all of the mouse mutants
thus far discussed share not only a defect in some aspect of genome maintenance accom-
panied by symptoms of premature aging, but also a series of enhanced cellular responses
that appear to converge on p53, the so-called guardian of the genome. In fact, defects in
the gene TP53, encoding this cell-cycle control protein, can also cause premature aging in
mice. The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that controls a network of genes
that regulates responses to DNA damage494. The p53 protein inhibits cell-cycle progres-
sion, facilitates DNA repair, and activates both cellular senescence and apoptosis path-
ways421. Two mutant alleles of TP53 have been described which, in combination with a
wild-type allele, result in multiple symptoms of aging and a shortened lifespan. The p44
allele, a naturally occurring splice variant ﬁrst described in 1987, lacks the ﬁrst transacti-
vation domain495. The other mutant allele, termed M, is an accidentally introduced dele-
tion of the 5' region of the TP53 gene, lacking both transactivation domains496. Both
mutants display prominent signs of premature aging, but the two animal models differ,
mainly in the severity of the symptoms. In the M mutant mice, in which expression of the
variant allele is very low,the ﬁrst symptoms of aging only become apparent at 18 months.
The p44 transgenic mice, which express the variant allele at a much higher level, already
174
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

show aging-related mortality as early as 5 months.Hence,severity is likely to be correlated
with the expression level of the mutant allele. In the p44 model it has been demonstrated
that with increasing p44 expression symptoms become much more severe. Interestingly,
an increase in p44 was found to alter IGF-1 signaling, by increasing both plasma IGF-1
levels and IGF-1 receptor levels in tissues495. The relevance of this ﬁnding is not com-
pletely clear, but it should be noted that the p53 pathway is interconnected with the IGF-
1/Akt pathways (as well as with the TOR pathway; see Chapter 2) in their joint role of
sensing growth factors, nutrients, oxygen, and stress497.
Both models display early osteoporosis and kyphosis, major forms of aging-related
pathology in both mice and humans. The p44 mice show early fertility loss, to some
extent caused by a breakdown of the reproductive axis (H. Scrable, personal communica-
tion). This loss of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis is very similar to the situation
in natural human and mouse aging498. This loss of fertility is not observed in the M
mutant, but again, the symptoms in that model are generally much less severe. Both
mouse models suffer from a typical aging-related redistribution of fat, resulting in loss of
subcutaneous fat.Other typical aging-related phenotypes in these mice are skin problems
and various forms of atrophy. Surprisingly, in both mutants cancer incidence was lower
than in the controls. Of note, mice expressing additional copies of wild-type p53 under
the control of its own promoter do not show signs of premature aging,but do show lower
cancer incidence499. In this case, the normal p53 gene dosage is minimally increased—by
one additional copy—resulting in an increased response to DNA damage without affect-
ing basal levels of p53. By contrast, in the two accelerated aging mutants, p53 may be
contitutively activated through an interaction of the mutant p53 allele with the wild-type
allele. This apparently results in postnatal growth impairment of the animals, possibly
caused by a reduced cell proliferation rate as observed in cultured ﬁbroblasts from these
animals495.It is also supported by the observation of a more rapid accumulation of senes-
cent cells in tissues of the p53	/M mice, as compared with control animals500. This was
based on staining for senescence-associated 
-galactosidase (SA-
-gal), the most widely
used biomarker for senescent cells and originally discovered by Judy Campisi and co-
workers501. However, it is unclear what such a marker, deﬁned as 
-galactosidase activity
detectable at pH 6.0, would indicate in liver cells normally not proliferating. It is possible
that SA-
-gal under such conditions reﬂects a stress response. Of note, increased rates of
apoptosis (programmed cell death) in these two mutant mouse models have not
been observed (H. Scrable and L. Donehower, personal communication). Indeed, the
hyperactive p53 protein most likely causes its effects through increased cell-cycle arrest,
leading to a general inhibition of cell proliferation. This may explain many of the
premature aging phenotypes. For example, impairment of osteoblast proliferation, a
likely natural cause of osteoporosis in the elderly, may cause the increased, premature
osteoporosis in these mutant mice.
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING
175

Overall, therefore, constitutively activated p53 activity appears to promote many
aging-related phenotypes through the inhibition of normal regenerative processes which
are essential for adult animals to survive and maintain organ function. This may be the
case, not only in the two TP53 mutants just discussed, but also in a host of other mouse
models harboring defects in genome maintenance. Indeed, in such animals increased
genotoxic stress would keep p53 continuously activated. The role of TP53 as a pro-aging
gene is schematically depicted in Fig. 5.6.As the guardian of the genome, p53 is supposed
to inhibit cell growth and proliferation, but probably only occasionally and transiently,
after a burst of spontaneous DNA damage. Whereas cancer is also a major aging-related
phenotype, constitutively activated p53 would be expected to greatly suppress tumor for-
mation due to its inhibition of normal cell-proliferative activities. This is exactly what is
often observed in mice with defects in genome maintenance. It is conceivable that in nor-
mal mice p53 responses naturally increase with age due to the aforementioned increased
load of DNA damage. This would then result in very similar phenotypes as in the p53
mutants, but later in life, as part of the normal aging process. Below I will discuss the pos-
sibility that the cellular response to DNA damage, rather than genome instability per se,
could be the cause of aging.

copy number of the gene for p53 in the context of its normal regulatory sequences (as part of a
bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC) clone) causes its exacerbated response, but not constitutive
activation. Constitutive activation of p53 (shading) can be accomplished through chronic DNA
damage (as in various mouse mutants harboring genetic defects in genome maintenance), or
through the M or p44 allele in the context of the normal p53 gene product. Note that in the p44
transgenic mice the ratio of p53 to its variant is altered in favor of the latter, as denoted by the
relative letter sizes.

5.4 Conclusions
In this chapter I reviewed a range of genetically engineered mouse models, harboring
speciﬁc defects in genome maintenance, and exhibiting a common array of aging-related
phenotypes,even though the mutated genes represent a diverse range of pathways.As dis-
cussed, the most convincing models undergo normal development and then prematurely
exhibit a set of common aging features. In such cases it is difﬁcult to maintain that these
mutants do not faithfully mimic aspects of the normal aging process. At this point in
time,the question is no longer whether the premature aging phenotypes in these mice are
genuine,but rather why different genetic defects in some aspect of the complex network of
genome maintenance all lead to very similar endpoints in aging. Of note, genome mainte-
nance is the only system in which such a wide variety of defects leads to such a recognizable
pattern of phenotypic changes.
How can so many clinical endpoints of aging undergo acceleration as a consequence of
genetic defects in a set of functional pathways that superﬁcially have no relationship to
the original function that is impaired; for example, bone metabolism, functional skin
mass, neuronal activity, and growth? As already alluded to, this observation points to a
key role of the network of genome-maintenance genes as the last line of defense against
aging by removing damage induced by metabolism-related ROS.
The key consideration here is that aging is characterized by progressive system dys-
function as a consequence of the loss of functional cells,ultimately driven by the accumu-
lation of DNA damage. This could reﬂect two major underlying processes. First, organ
and tissue dysfunction could be caused by cellular responses to DNA damage, including
apoptosis and cellular senescence. Second, cells could degenerate by a process of intrinsic
aging, possibly driven by increased genomic alterations. Whereas the former would
mainly result in various forms of tissue atrophy and loss of regenerative capacity,
increased genomic instability at old age is likely to contribute to the well documented
exponential increase in cancer during aging. Indeed, hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions
can comprise as much as 50% of all pathological lesions observed at old age439. However,
an increased load of genomic mutations, including sequence alterations and methylation
changes, could also lead to a progressive increase in the number of dysfunctional cells,
without causing them to immediately die or become transformed. We can call such cells
senescent cells and they may include permanently arrested cells, as a consequence of
replicative senescence421 (for a discussion of the phenomenon of cell senescence and its
implications for aging in vivo, see Chapter 7). Similar to increased cell death, an increased
fraction of dysfunctional cells would be expected to lead to organ dysfunction.
As we have seen, in all mouse models of premature aging the genetic defect leads to
increased impairment of growth and cellular proliferation,either through cell-cycle arrest,
or other elicited DNA-damage responses, such as replicative senescence and apoptosis. In
many of these mutants we also see an increase in mutations; irreversible changes in DNA
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING
177

sequence due to misreplication or misrepair. This increased genomic instability promotes
the emergence of cancer cells but is so dramatic that it ultimately represses tumor progres-
sion,due to increased anti-cancer responses,such as apoptosis.Indeed,deletion of p53 res-
cues the premature replicative senescence phenotype often observed in cells from mice
with defects in genome maintenance502. This suggests that many of the premature aging
phenotypes in mice with defects in genome maintenance are caused by cellular responses
to DNA damage,including the activity of a p53-dependent cell-cycle checkpoint (Fig.5.6).
Are these same cellular responses, identiﬁed in the mouse models as a likely cause of
their accelerated aging,also responsible for normal aging? There can be no doubt that loss
of cells per se contributes to normal aging and that various forms of atrophy are common
among older mice or humans. Hence, part of normal aging is likely to be also due to the
adverse effects of cellular responses to DNA damage.However,normal aging is not gener-
ally associated with the dramatic forms of growth reduction, tissue atrophy, and loss of
organ functional mass as observed in many of the models of accelerated aging. For exam-
ple, the symptoms of aging in the Xpd mouse model listed in Table 5.2 are much more
severe than would be expected from their biological age as derived from the survival
curve. Indeed, these data were obtained by complete histopathology at the end of life.
Hence, one would expect to see an incidence and severity level very similar to the control
animals, but this is not the case. Hence, it is possible that accelerated aging in many of
these models is mainly caused by excessive cellular responses to genomic stress, in con-
trast to normal aging, which is more likely due to a gradual accumulation of persistent
DNA damage or mutations. Indeed, the bursts of DNA damage necessary to evoke, for
example, an apoptosis response, must be quite rare during normal aging, as can be
derived from the extremely low number of apoptotic cells in tissues of normally aged ani-
mals. Whereas even very low numbers of apoptotic cells at a given time point may still
correspond to a signiﬁcant cell turnover,this is not necessarily a bad thing.Indeed,caloric
restriction has been found associated with slight increases in apoptosis407, which may
point towards a healthy cell turnover to eliminate defective cells so that they can be
replaced by new ones from the stem-cell reservoirs. Only when apoptosis levels are exces-
sive,as is the case in several of the mouse models just discussed,are organ and tissue cellu-
larity likely to become adversely affected. As will be discussed in Chapter 7, there is no
convincing evidence for excessive cell loss or depletion of stem-cell reservoirs at old age.
Nevertheless,at this point in time it is not possible to conclude that normative aging is not
based on cell loss; it just seems unlikely.
As discussed extensively in the next chapter, normal steady-state levels of DNA dam-
age, such as 8-oxoG, are extremely low503 and therefore also unlikely to directly cause
aging-related degenerative defects. However, DNA damage can be turned into mutations
by erroneous processing of DNA damage. Evidently, the frequency of such events is low,
as exempliﬁed by the normally low frequency of neoplastic transformation.However,it is
likely that many mutations of different kinds (from point mutations to large genome
178
GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

rearrangements and aneuploidy) are needed to generate a tumor cell.Most of such muta-
tions do not involve actual genes, but gene-regulatory sequences. Indeed, rather than a
catalog of useful genes interspersed with functionless DNA, each chromosome is now
viewed as a complex information organelle with sophisticated maintenance and control
systems.In this concept of a genome,each part has a function,even its non-protein-coding
parts.Such a holistic view of the genome would assign a variety of functions to non-coding
DNA (e.g.structural maintenance,gene regulation).The continuous process of irreversible
alteration of the DNA sequence organization of the genome would lead to a mosaic of
cells with each individual cell in a tissue bearing a different pattern of genomic scars504.
Rather than the inactivation of unique genes with unique functions, which has thus far
been given primacy, a scenario of an initially tolerable loss of genome structural integrity
is more likely. This could lead to increased loss of function, highly variable from cell to
cell, thus contributing to increased organ dysfunction. Hence, whereas age-related sys-
tems dysfunction in premature aging may predominantly involve cellular responses
evoking proliferation impairment and programmed cell death, normal aging could
mostly be due to the gradual accumulation of persistent genomic or epigenomic alter-
ations leading to a progressive increase of dysfunctional cells.Both scenarios would result
in organ and tissue dysfunction. Figure 5.7 schematically depicts the hypothetical causes

Fig. 5.7 DNA damage, the adverse by-product of normal growth and metabolism, may be a
major driver of the aging process. Whereas in accelerated aging cellular responses impairing cell
proliferation (apoptosis, cellular senescence) as a consequence of defects in genome mainte-
nance are likely to be mainly responsible for the aging phenotype, in wild-type animals or
mutants showing delayed aging, cellular responses may be much less important and aging
mainly the result of cell-functional decline.

of aging as driven by DNA damage for (1) accelerated aging, mostly due to adverse effects
of cellular responses to DNA damage; (2) normal aging, with a reduced role of cellular
responses, and (epi)genomic alterations as the main cause of cell and organ dysfunction;
and (3) delayed aging with reduced cellular responses as well as reduced accumulation of
irreversible, (epi)genomic alterations.
It would be premature to consider DNA damage as the sole driving force of aging in all
multicellular organisms. However, based on the model systems now available, it accounts
for a signiﬁcant number of the observations that have been made. Of note, DNA damage
as the original driver of a universal process of aging has some inherent logic. After all,
damage to nucleic acids is the most ancient example of damage accumulation in the liv-
ing world.Ever since the ﬁrst replicators,genetic damage posed both a fundamental prob-
lem and an opportunity for living systems.A problem,because genetic damage essentially
prevents the perpetuation of life, since it interferes with replication (and transcription);
an opportunity,because it allows the generation of genetic variation through errors in the
replication or repair of a damaged template, thereby facilitating evolutionary change.
Genetic stability in somatic cells of metazoa has become part of the trade-off between the
allocation of scarce resources to either reproduction or somatic maintenance and is not
expected to be maximized.Whereas the concept of DNA damage as a main driver of aging
is intuitively attractive, evolutionary logic dictates that other causes of aging would have
emerged over evolutionary time (Chapter 2). To judge whether genome instability is
likely to play a causal role in aging it will be necessary to assess the rate and severity of
genome alterations in normal individual animals during their lifetime.This is the topic of
the next chapter.

GENOME INSTABILITY AND ACCELERATED AGING

The aging genome
Spontaneous instability of the nuclear genome of somatic cells has been considered as a
possible explanation for aging since the 1940s when the biological effects of high-energy
radiation were ﬁrst systematically studied in mice505. These studies were part of the
Manhattan project and undertaken when it was realized that the personnel involved in
the production of radioactive isotopes needed protection. Hence, an experimental basis
was needed to establish tolerance levels.It was found that small periodic doses of fast neu-
trons or 
 rays resulted in premature aging, as indicated by the acceleration of typical
end-of-life pathology, such as generalized atrophy and lymphomas. Shortening of life-
span was found to be a function of the daily dose. It is not surprising, then, that after the
discovery of the DNA double helix in 1953, the ﬁrst somatic mutation theories were for-
mulated by physicists.They reasoned that since radiation was known to induce mutations
in DNA,aging could be the result of life-long exposure to low,natural levels of background
radiation392,506. At the time, not much was known about the mechanisms underlying
mutation induction. DNA damage still remained to be discovered and nothing was
known about the relentless stream of DNA chemical lesions inﬂicted continuously on the
cells of the body. Nevertheless, the logic behind the general idea that somatic mutations
are the cause of aging was already then compelling.
Instability of the nuclear genome is a broad concept. Distinctions should be made
between DNA damage, DNA mutations, and epigenomic DNA alterations. DNA damage
includes chemical alterations in DNA structure, leading to a non-informative template;
that is, a structure that can no longer serve as a substrate for faithful replication or tran-
scription. As a consequence of DNA damage mutations can be introduced, for example,
by mishandling of the damage by repair or replication processes.DNA mutations are her-
itable changes in genomic DNA sequence or in their organization, which are transmitted
to daughter cells or to offspring (when they occur in germ cells).Mutations can vary from
point mutations, involving single or very few base pairs, to large deletions, insertions,
duplications, inversions, and translocations. In organisms with multiple chromosomes,
DNA from one chromosome can be joined to another and the actual chromosome num-
ber can be affected. Epigenomic alterations are changes in patterns of DNA modiﬁcation,
such as methylation patterns or the histone code, which are heritable and can inﬂuence
patterns of gene expression without altering the sequence of base pairs.
In a strict sense, changes in histone proteins that would alter the information that can
be retrieved from the genome are not genome alterations but alterations in chromatin,the

ordered complex of DNA and protein that forms the chromosomes. In this chapter I will
refer to all three types of alteration collectively as genome alterations. Epigenomic
proﬁles, once established, are only partially stable and can vary substantially as compared
with the more static DNA-sequence code. This has to do with the role of epigenomic
changes in orchestrating various cellular activities, as we have seen in Chapter 3.
Furthermore, the epigenome also varies in a stochastic manner, similar to the random
alteration in the genome’s DNA sequences. Because epigenomic patterns are thought to
be erased during maturation of the germ line and then re-programmed, they are gener-
ally considered not to contribute to the transmission of information from one generation
to the next. However, there is some evidence that this is incorrect and that there are cases
of meiotic inheritance of epigenomic states507.
As discussed in the previous chapters,genome instability as a potential cause of aging is
based on the need to provide for evolutionary diversity.The price to pay for such diversity
is the continuous threat of population extinction when the mutation load of the germ
cells becomes too high. Sexual reproduction has greatly facilitated the maintenance of
this precarious balance by its capacity to generate individuals with lighter mutation loads
through recombination. Relatively small, asexual populations are unable to do that and,
as a consequence, tend to lose mutation-free genomes (due to genetic drift) and
inevitably suffer from loss of viability73. Such fates and their similarities to aging have
been discussed in Chapter 2 for protozoa and for E. coli.While this explains the advantage
of recombination and therefore sexual reproduction, ﬁtness loss as a consequence of
mutation accumulation is not limited to asexual organisms. Indeed, reduced ﬁtness due
to mutation accumulation in the germ line has been demonstrated, under certain condi-
tions,in Drosophila508 and C.elegans509.In a somewhat simplistic manner one could argue
that what is true for germ cells should be true for somatic cells, especially since the evolu-
tionary theory of aging would not predict that any adverse effects associated with high
mutation loads become subject to natural selection as long as they occur at late age, after
the reproductive period (Chapter 2).Somatic cell populations have only limited opportu-
nity to lighten the burden of their mutation loads through apoptosis or senescence
because this would lead to cell loss and organ dysfunction.
In spite of the logic of ascribing aging to mutation accumulation,analogous to the gen-
eration of genetic variability in the germ line, some serious criticisms against the hypoth-
esis were expressed almost from the very beginning. In 1962, John Maynard Smith
critically reviewed the possible causes of aging according to the information then avail-
able510. Many of the arguments presented in this lucid paper are still absolutely valid and
contributed greatly to our understanding of aging. However, Maynard Smith’s discussion
of somatic mutations as a possible cause of aging in Drosophila clearly reﬂects the lack of
insight at that time as to how mutations arise. The key issue, which also obscured the
interpretation of the results obtained with the haploid and diploid wasps of the genus
182
THE AGING GENOME

Habrobracon (Chapter 2), is DNA damage and the cellular responses to it. For example,
Maynard Smith argued that there are reasons for expecting a single concentrated dose of
radiation to produce more mutations than a smaller dose spread over a longer time. We
now know that the opposite is true due to the higher toxicity associated with the acute
dose, which will prevent many mutations from reaching ﬁxation. The ignorance of DNA
damage as the intermediate between the mutagen and its mutational consequences has
plagued a correct evaluation of the somatic mutation hypothesis ever since.
The emergence on the stage of DNA damage immediately raises the question of
whether this type of genome alteration can itself be a cause of aging,or its molecular con-
sequences in the form of mutations; that is, changes in DNA-sequence content. In addi-
tion, the recent realization that epigenomic modiﬁcations should also be considered as
genuine changes in the genetic code introduces yet another potentially pro-aging type of
genome alteration. Like DNA-sequence alterations, epigenomic changes are now consid-
ered as causes of cancer. The question addressed in this chapter involves the types of
genome alteration that occur spontaneously in organisms, and their frequencies in aging
cells and tissues.
6.1 DNA damage
Apart from errors made during information transfer per se, the ultimate source of per-
manent genetic changes, including DNA mutations and epigenomic changes, is the con-
tinuous introduction of chemical lesions in the DNA by a variety of environmental and
endogenous, physical, chemical, and biological agents (Fig. 6.1). In contrast to DNA
mutations, the induction of DNA damage is a frequent event. As discussed in Chapter 4,
there are tens of thousands of spontaneous lesions inﬂicted on the genome of a typical
cell on a single day. These lesions need to be repaired quickly to prevent rapid cellular
degeneration and death. DNA damage has drawn ample attention in the past because of
its causal relationship with cancer. This has led to an extensive research effort to identify
the critical lesions causally related to the various types of cancer in humans. Whereas
the early focus was on environmental agents,it was later realized by Larry Loeb511 (Seattle,
WA, USA), Bruce Ames245 (Berkeley, CA, USA), and others that endogenous genotox-
icants were probably much more important in causing the majority of spontaneous
tumors. The focus of these studies was on humans and rodent model systems, which
explains why most of what we know about DNA damage is from work with mammalian
systems. Before discussing the evidence for DNA damage persisting with age and its
potential functional impact, I will brieﬂy review the different sources of DNA damage,
focusing on mammalian genomes.

6.1.1 POTENTIAL SOURCES OF DNA DAMAGE
6.1.1.1 Endogenous sources
Most data on DNA-damage induction,from either endogenous or environmental sources,
are estimates, mostly based on experiments with isolated DNA; quantitative data on the
spontaneous induction of endogenous DNA damage in cells and tissues of higher animals
are for the most part still lacking,with the exception of some relatively recent results on the
presence of oxidative lesions, such as 8-oxoG (Table 6.1). Much of what we know of spon-
taneous DNA damage, including the enormous magnitude of the problem, derives from
the pioneering work of Tomas Lindahl (South Mimms, Herts, UK)512. Lindahl also greatly
contributed to our current insights into the main pathway for repairing the vast majority
of spontaneous DNA damage—base excision repair (BER)—and his work will be exten-
sively cited below.

Subsequent processing of the damage by DNA repair and DNA-damage signaling systems can
result in a number of molecular and cellular endpoints, including mutations, altered gene expres-
sion, and cell death. Note that DNA damage itself is generally not an endpoint, but continuously
induced and repaired.

of DNA and its deoxyribose is relatively labile and can easily be broken, resulting in
apurinic or apyrimidinic sites (AP sites). From experiments in which the release of
labeled bases was measured in double-stranded Bacillus subtilis DNA,incubated at differ-
ent temperatures, Lindahl and Nyberg513 estimated that at the normal body temperature
of 37C about 10 000 depurinations are induced per mammalian cell per day.
Apyrimidinic sites are formed at a signiﬁcantly lower rate. In isolated DNA at 37C AP
sites are spontaneously converted into SSBs in a few days514. This number may even be
higher. Based on measurements from Crine and Verly515 of the spontaneous degradation
of isolated T7 phage DNA in vitro at 37C (using alkaline sucrose-gradient centrifuga-
tion), Saul and Ames516 calculated that about 20 000–40 000 breaks per cell are induced
per day. According to Crine and Verly most of the breaks found were generated by the
spontaneous destruction of deoxyribose moieties or direct hydrolysis of phosphodiester
bonds and not by depurination.
Other forms of water-induced DNA alterations include the deamination of cytosine to
uracil and, to a smaller extent, the deamination of adenine and guanine to hypoxanthine
and xanthine, respectively517,518. As discussed in Chapter 4, uracil, hypoxanthine, and
xanthine can be removed from cellular DNA enzymatically by the speciﬁc glycosylases
of the BER process, resulting in AP sites. Less frequently occurring heat-induced DNA

modiﬁcations are caused by hydrolytic reactions such as the opening of the imidazole
ring of adenine, hydration of pyrimidines, and conversion of deoxyguanosine to deoxy-
neoguanosine519.
At present only limited information is available as to the actual formation of SSB
and AP sites in tissues of higher animals in vivo. Since DNA in vivo is tightly packed
together with proteins, the induction of damage might be quite different from the situa-
tion in vitro. In 1998 Nakamura et al. reported results obtained with a novel, highly sensi-
tive assay for AP sites, indicating a steady-state level of 23 000 of such lesions per cell in a
human B lymphoblastoid cell line520. To put this in perspective, such a number for one
of the most frequently occurring lesions corresponds to only four AP sites per 106
nucleotides.
Oxygen A mechanism contributing to the second, major endogenous source of DNA
damage is the generation of oxygen free radicals associated with a variety of normal cellu-
lar processes. Important classes of such free radicals, also termed reactive oxygen species
(ROS), are the active oxygen species superoxide (O2
), singlet oxygen (1O2), and the
hydroxyl radical (OH). A major source of ROS is the sequential reduction of oxygen to
water as part of the process of oxidative phosphorylation, our main energy generator
(Fig. 6.2). However, ROS are also by-products of enzyme systems, such as the cytochrome
P450 systems involved in the detoxiﬁcation of toxic chemicals,and xanthine oxidase,a key
enzyme in purine catabolism521. The reaction of ROS with cell membranes can initiate a
radical chain reaction, leading to the oxidation of unsaturated lipids present in these
membranes and resulting in lipid radicals, such as lipid-peroxy radicals, fatty acid
hydroperoxides,and cholesterol epoxides522.ROS are also generated through the oxidation
of small molecules, such as thiols, hydroquinones, and ﬂavins523.Whereas ROS can clearly
damage a variety of vital cellular constituents,such as proteins,membrane lipids,carbohy-
drates, and nucleic acids, they are also functionally important in a variety of signaling
processes. In the innate immune system, polymorphonuclear leukocytes or granulocytes
are activated for phagocytosis,and these cells produce ROS and reactive nitrogen species in
amounts sufﬁcient to kill invading bacteria. ROS have been proposed as regulators of
apoptosis524.A possible critical factor in this process is p66SHC,the inactivation of which in
the mouse decreases the incidence of aging-associated diseases, such as atherosclerosis,

and prolongs lifespan449,525, as we have seen in Chapter 2. p66shc is a redox enzyme that
generates mitochondrial ROS (hydrogen peroxide) as signaling molecules for apoptosis526.
Hence, there must be a balance between ROS formation and the various antioxidant
systems that defend cells against the adverse effects of ROS. Such systems include simple
antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C, 
-carotene, uric acid, and numerous other 
so-called free-radical scavengers that can react with ROS. Probably even more important
are a variety of enzyme systems that can deactivate ROS. They include superoxide dismu-
tase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, each of which has several representa-
tives. Together, antioxidant systems function as a ﬁrst-line defense against oxidative DNA
damage. It is for this reason that in Chapter 4 they have been categorized as a genome-
maintenance system.
Much knowledge concerning free-radical reactions with DNA has been derived from
studies with radiation (e.g. 
 rays, X-rays, and UV radiation). The transfer of radiation
energy to cellular compounds, such as water, results in the formation of ROS. Indeed,
OH radicals are responsible for 70–80% of the SSBs induced by 
 rays527,528. In DNA of
cultured cells or in isolated DNA, 
 ray-induced radicals give rise to a variety of oxidative
lesions, including SSBs, DSBs,AP sites, and cross-links, but also to several modiﬁed bases
such as 8-oxoG, thymine glycol, and 5-hydroxymethyluracil529,530.
There is both indirect and direct evidence that small, oxidative base damages are
formed in cells of higher animals in vivo. The modiﬁed bases mentioned above, and also
thymidine glycol, have been found in the urine of rats and humans, which has been inter-
preted as an indication for the continuous induction and removal of these and other
DNA-oxidation products in mammalian tissues531,532. Interestingly, the amount of both
thymine glycol and thymidine glycol per kilogram of body weight found in the urine of
short-lived animals (rats and mice) is higher than that in the urine of long-lived animals
(monkeys and humans), suggesting a higher induction of oxidative DNA damage in the
short-lived species533. This would be in accordance with the higher rate of mitochondrial
ROS production per unit of body weight in short-lived mammals than in long-lived ones,
such as humans534, which in turn would be expected to lead to an increased formation of
oxidative damage. According to calculations made by Saul et al.532, about 1000 of these
DNA-oxidation products (thymine glycols, thymidine glycols, and 5-hydroxymethylu-
racil) are induced in each human cell per day (Table 6.1), whereas about 15 000 of such
lesions are generated per day in the genome of a rat cell.
More direct evidence for the presence of oxidative DNA damage in cells in vivo has
been obtained through the development of sensitive assays, based on high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography. There are at least 20 known
products of DNA oxidation, with 8-oxoG likely to be the most frequent one, comprising
perhaps 5% of the total535. As we have seen in Chapter 4, this lesion base pairs preferen-
tially with adenine rather than cytosine and this generates transversion mutations after
replication. Whereas initially very high levels of 8-oxoG in animal tissues were reported
THE AGING GENOME
187

(as many as three per 105 dGs), it is now clear that most of these lesions were artifacts of
the experimental procedure to measure them536,537. Increased precautions to prevent
oxidation at various stages of sample preparation have now led to the assumption that the
real level is likely to be no more than 1–10 8-oxoGs per 107 dGs.Indeed,at the laboratory of
Arlan Richardson (San Antonio, TX, USA) steady-state levels of this lesion of only several
hundred per cell were found in various mouse tissues503 (see also below). Interestingly, as
originally discovered in laboratory of Bruce Ames, the level of 8-oxoG is an order of
magnitude higher in mtDNA than in nuclear DNA538, which is not unexpected since
mitochondria are a major source of ROS.This was comﬁrmed by the group of Richardson.
Sugar Glucose reacts non-enzymatically with proteins and lipids in vivo, chemically
forming covalently attached glucose-addition products and cross-links termed advanced
glycation end products (AGEs)539. AGE formation is increased in situations with hyper-
glycemia (e.g. diabetes mellitus) and is also stimulated by oxidative stress. AGEs are the
products of the Maillard reaction, a complex set of non-enzymatic protein browning and
cross-linking reactions. AGEs can react with DNA to form speciﬁc lesions540. However,
glucose and other reducing sugars can also react non-enzymatically with the amino
groups of DNA bases, which can lead to the formation of DNA adducts and mutations.
The frequency of these lesions is unknown, but most likely only a fraction of the above-
mentioned AP sites and oxidation products541.
Methyl donors As also mentioned in Chapter 4,a potentially important source of endoge-
nous DNA damage is S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the normal intracellular methyl-
group donor542,543. Non-enzymatic transmethylation from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to
DNA occurs at a slow rate. This reaction can lead to the formation of N7-methylguanine,
N3-methyladenine and small amounts of O6-methylguanine.The methylation of guanine
and adenine bases causes a further destabilization of the N-glycosylic bond, resulting in
an increased spontaneous cleavage and the formation of AP sites513. It has been estimated
that about 600 N3-methyladenine residues per day are generated in a human cell through
non-enzymatic methylation from S-adenosyl-L-methionine512. This is a toxic lesion,
which can be efﬁciently removed through BER, as we have seen.
6.1.1.2 Exogenous sources
Although endogenous sources of DNA damage now appear to be the most important,
various exogenous sources should not be ignored. The extent of exposure of human indi-
viduals to such sources is, of course, determined predominantly by lifestyle, occupation,
and place of residence (Table 6.1).
The human diet contains a great variety of natural mutagens and carcinogens, such as
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),aﬂatoxin B1,and nitrosamines544.These agents or
188
THE AGING GENOME

their metabolites can react with DNA, thereby forming several types of lesion, including
SSBs, DSBs, and bulky adducts. Cigarette smoke also contains various carcinogenic
compounds, including benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). DNA adducts induced by BaP have been
detected—by using the 32P-postlabeling assay (see below)—in placental tissue, bronchus,
and lung of heavy smokers545–547. My former mentor, Paul Lohman, then in Rijswijk, The
Netherlands,developed highly sensitive assays for speciﬁc DNA lesions on the basis of mono-
clonal antibodies. One such antibody, against the reaction product of BaP diol epoxide with
guanine,was able to detect DNA adducts in the bronchial cells of heavy smokers548.
Like other non-polar, chemically unreactive compounds, BaP needs to undergo meta-
bolic activation to yield more reactive forms that can then interact with nucleophilic
centers in DNA549. Another well-known example of such a compound is N2-acetyl-2-
aminoﬂuorene (2-AAF), an aromatic amine. Metabolic activation occurs through the
action of speciﬁc metabolizing enzymes.These enzymes function to protect the cell against
the toxic effects of such compounds by converting them into water-soluble, excretable
forms. Unfortunately, in some cases they yield electrophiles, which attack DNA (and
other macromolecules with nucleophilic centers).The best known metabolizing system is
the aforementioned cytochrome P450 system. The actions of these enzymes, which
involve oxygenation, produce ROS as yet another genotoxic by-product. Since we have
already seen that ROS are also a by-product of ionizing radiation, it is often very difﬁcult
to know the exact source of the effect of environmental genotoxic agents. For example,
Erik Mullaart,a student in my laboratory at the time,demonstrated that after oral adminis-
tration of BaP to rats the main source of DNA damage is not the carcinogen–DNA
adduct, but oxidative damage resulting from the free radicals that are a by-product of the
metabolization550. Other indirect effects of chemical carcinogens that act through ROS
are caused by the binding of carcinogens to the cell membrane.This results in stimulation
of the arachidonic acid cascade, which elicits an oxidative burst and disturbs the
membrane structure. In this way active oxygen species as well as lipid peroxidation and
aldehydic degradation products are generated and these bring the cell into a so-called
pro-oxidant state551. These highly reactive secondary radicals can induce DNA damage,
although the carcinogens themselves do not react with the DNA.
A major exogenous source of DNA damage is sunlight. The extent of exposure to
sunlight is determined by both lifestyle and place of residence. Recreational forms of sun
exposure lead to high levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine
6–4 pyrimidone photoproducts (6–4PPs), the main DNA lesions induced by the UV
component of sunlight, in the DNA of skin cells552.
Also, occupational exposure to genotoxic agents can lead to the induction of DNA
damage. High levels of BaP diol epoxide–DNA adducts were detected in lymphocytes of
individuals known to be exposed to high levels of BaP, such as coke-oven workers553,
roofers, and foundry workers554,555. Generally, the level of adducts in these individuals
correlated with the exposure level, but the inter-individual variation was large.
THE AGING GENOME
189

A further external source of DNA damage is formed by the natural background level of
ionizing radiation, which is about 2  103 Gy/year556. Gy stands for Grey, which is the
unit for the damage done to tissue by ionizing radiation. To put this in perspective, the
lowest amount of ionizing radiation which leads to obvious effects, such as vomiting, loss
of appetite,and generalized discomfort (mainly known from research on people who sur-
vived the atomic-bomb explosions in Japan in 1945) is 1–2 Gy. Our daily background of
ionizing radiation seems therefore to be very small and probably induces about 5  103
SSBs/cell per day. However, it should be noted that there can be large variations in the
extent of exposure. For instance, the level of radiation originating from radon (222Rn),
which is present in the earth but also in building materials, can vary from 3  104 to
3  103 Gy/year557. It is also unclear as yet if there is a threshold level below which radia-
tion has no adverse effects. The effect of radon exposure on the rate of chromosomal
aberrations in white blood cells has been studied in groups of people chronically exposed
to different radon concentrations. Apart from a signiﬁcant increase of such aberrations
with age (see below), high concentrations of radon did not have an effect558.
In addition, exposure to radiation for medical purposes has been demonstrated to
induce DNA damage. Using the 
 H2AX assay mentioned in Chapter 4, DSBs have been
detected in lymphocytes from individuals undergoing computed tomography examina-
tion and found to be repaired within 1 day559.
6.1.2 DNA DAMAGE AS A FUNCTION OF AGE
Since there are so many different types of DNA lesion forming continuously, either as a
consequence of endogenous sources or through environmental exposure, it is important
to ﬁndthose that are most likely to exert adverse effects that may give rise to aging-associated
phenotypes. For example, whereas we have seen that the most frequent type of sponta-
neous damage is probably an AP site, a lesion that is both cytotoxic and mutagenic, the
efﬁcient repair of such lesions makes it unlikely that a large number of them persist to
cause an effect. It is possible, therefore, that certain slowly accumulating, minor lesions
are more important, but those will be difﬁcult to detect.
A major determinant of lesion accumulation is undoubtedly the quality of genome
maintenance. As described in Chapter 4, the cell is equipped with a large variety of
genome-maintenance systems to prevent the induction of damage, remove it after induc-
tion, or eliminate cells that are beyond repair. As discussed, somatic maintenance and
repair systems are not maximized,providing a margin of error that could lead to a gradual
accumulation of DNA damage with age. An age-related decline in the efﬁciency of these
defense systems would accelerate the rate of such an accumulation during aging. As we
have seen from Chapter 4,there is no evidence for drastic declines in genome maintenance
with age, which may simply not be tolerated by the organism. Nevertheless, the sole fact
that molecular defense systems are imperfect necessitates direct studies on the possibility
190
THE AGING GENOME

that DNA damage and other genome alterations accumulate with age. Methodological
aspects are of critical importance in such studies. First, methods need to be sensitive
enough to detect and quantify low levels of DNA damage. Second, such methods cannot
rely on metabolic labeling, but should instead be able to measure DNA lesions in freshly
isolated cells or tissue samples. In the following sections I will review the progress that has
been made over the last few decades in developing such assays and their application in
studying spontaneous DNA damage and its accumulation with age in mammals.
6.1.2.1 DNA breaks/alkali-labile sites
Various attempts have been made to demonstrate an age-related increase in SSBs and
DSBs, or damage such as AP sites, that are converted into DNA breaks during treatment
with alkali (alkali-labile sites). Traditionally, sucrose-gradient centrifugation has been
employed for this purpose under neutral or alkaline conditions. Later, more sensitive
assays were developed560.
By using alkaline sucrose-gradient centrifugation, alkaline elution, and alkaline
unwinding,SSBs,DSBs,and alkali-labile sites can be detected.The S1-nuclease assay only
detects SSBs, DSBs, or stretches of single-stranded DNA. Using the nucleoid sedimenta-
tion assay, in which the sedimentation rate of nucleoids through a neutral sucrose gradi-
ent is determined, only SSBs and DSBs can be detected. Nucleoids are what are left after
cells are lysed with non-ionic detergent at high salt concentration, which removes mem-
branes, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm, and retains only the nuclear matrix with the nega-
tively supercoiled DNA (see Chapter 3). Nucleoid sedimentation, however, can easily be
inﬂuenced by other alterations in the DNA, such as conformational changes. This was
shown by Michael Boerrigter, a student in my laboratory561, and by others562. Indeed, the
differences between these aspeciﬁc methods for detecting DNA damage are often criti-
cally important to correctly interpret the results.
More recently, the so-called comet assay, also known as the single cell gel assay, has
become one of the standard methods for assessing DNA damage563. It is generally used to
measure SSBs,DSBs or alkali-labile sites in DNA of individual cells,lysed with a detergent
in the presence of high salt and subsequently subjected to electrophoresis in a gel. The
migration streaks of such cells, termed comets, are measures of the level of DNA frag-
mentation under the conditions applied. In its essence the comet assay is a greatly simpli-
ﬁed form of nucleoid sedimentation.
Although all these methods essentially lack speciﬁcity and are designed for measuring
DNA breaks,the use of different conditions (e.g.neutral versus alkaline,the use of lesion-
speciﬁc endonucleases), make them more versatile and allow detection of, for example,
UV-induced pyrimidine dimers, oxidized bases, and alkylation damage.
In the liver, an age-related increase in the level of SSBs and/or alkali-labile sites was
found when measured by alkaline sucrose-gradient centrifugation564.This was conﬁrmed
by results obtained using alkaline elution by Lawson and Stohs565 and by Erik Mullaart in
THE AGING GENOME
191

my own laboratory566 (Fig.6.3).In addition,we also demonstrated that such an age-related
increase in DNA damage in rat liver only takes place in postmitotic parenchymal cells
and not in the non-parenchymal liver cells, which still have proliferative activity566. By
calibrating the alkaline elution proﬁles to the known amounts of breaks obtained after
irradiation of cells with different doses of 
 rays, we determined that freshly isolated liver
parenchymal cells of young rats contained about 900 alkali-labile sites. The cells from old
rats contained almost twice that number, 1600. Presumably, these numbers should reﬂect
the steady-state level of such lesions in cells in vivo.
Chetsanga et al.567, found a large age-related increase (5-fold) in the fraction of DNA
sensitive to S1-nuclease in mouse liver, indicating an increase in the percentage of single-
stranded DNA. However, using the same assay but other mouse strains, no such age-
related difference in the level of single-stranded DNA was observed in liver568,569.
No age-related difference in the level of SSBs and alkali-labile sites could be detected in
mouse brain by using alkaline sucrose gradients564 or in rat brain with alkaline elution570.
This is in agreement with data from Walker and Bachelard571, which indicate the absence
of an age-related difference in the level of SSBs detected by nucleoid sedimentation in rat
brain nuclei. However, using the S1-nuclease assay Chetsanga et al.572 demonstrated an
age-related increase in the level of single-stranded DNA in rat brain. In addition, the

Fig. 6.3 An example of alkaline elution of DNA from rat liver hepatocytes. In these experiments,
cells are lysed in an alkaline solution on a membrane ﬁlter. The rate of elution of the DNA through
the ﬁlter is a measure of the number of DNA breaks present in the cells or induced by the alkaline
treatment. The more rapid elution of the DNA from cells of the old rats indicates an increase in
DNA damage in the liver of these animals with age.

extent of unwinding of DNA in alkali, a measure for the amount of SSBs and alkali-labile
sites, was found to increase with age both in rat brain and in liver cells, but not in intes-
tinal cells573.
The comet assay was used to study alkali-labile sites in peripheral blood lymphocytes
of human individuals of different ages574,575. The results did not indicate a different basal
level of damage in old compared with young individuals. However, they did point
towards increased cell-to-cell variation as well as increased interindividual heterogeneity
in the older population. Increased stochasticity is one of the hallmarks of the aging
process and can be observed at all levels. This lack of an age-related increase in breaks or
alkali-labile sites in human lymphocytes was conﬁrmed by later results obtained by
Michael Boerrigter in my laboratory using alkaline elution (M. Boerrigter, unpublished
work). More recently, no evidence for an age-related increase in DNA breaks in lympho-
cytes of rats was obtained by Gedik et al.576.
DSBs were always difﬁcult to detect in vivo due to their small numbers. However, with
the recent introduction of 
 H2AX as a marker for the repair of DSBs, which can be
detected by immunohistochemistry using speciﬁc antibodies (see also Chapter 4), an
important dosimeter has been obtained for this type of damage. Using this assay, it has
been demonstrated that 
 H2AX foci increase with age in several mouse tissues,including
liver and brain, as well as in normal human ﬁbroblasts during senescence, with the num-
ber of foci-free cells decreasing272. These lesions appeared to be persistent, which was in
contrast to similar lesions induced by ionizing radiation.Hence,the DSBs associated with
aging or cellular senescence appeared to be unrepairable. Interestingly, others, using this
same assay, found that DSBs induced in cultures of nondividing primary human ﬁbrob-
lasts by very low radiation doses remained unrepaired for many days,in strong contrast to
efﬁcient DSB repair that was observed at higher doses.The level of DSBs in irradiated cul-
tures was found to decrease to that of unirradiated cell cultures if the cells were allowed to
proliferate after irradiation, presumably due to the elimination of the cells carrying unre-
pairable DSBs577. What these ﬁndings basically indicate is that highly toxic DSBs can be
present in normal cells over extended periods of time, during which they may give rise to
chromosomal aberrations.
6.1.2.2 Base damage
I-spots A lack of assays sensitive enough for the detection of speciﬁc base damages has
precluded the accurate assessment of such lesions in tissues at different ages. One of
the ﬁrst systems suitable for this purpose was the 32P-postlabeling method developed
by Gupta et al.578. The method, which is based on DNA digestion, enrichment of the
modiﬁed base, radioactive labeling using [
-32P]ATP, and chromatographic separa-
tion of the 32P-labeled modiﬁed bases, is used mainly for detecting adducts induced by
aromatic carcinogens, such as the aforementioned BaP and 2-AAF. Adduct-containing
THE AGING GENOME
193

nucleotides are identiﬁed by comparisons with synthetic markers for those adducts one
expects to ﬁnd.
Interestingly, using the 32P-postlabeling assay, the Randerath group found an increased
level of several unknown DNA adducts in rat liver, kidney, heart, and lung of 10-month-
old rats as compared with 1-month-old animals579. They called these adducts I-spots
because they arise indigenously. Later, similar adducts were also found in mtDNA at an
approx. 2-fold higher level than in nuclear DNA580. The highest level of adducts (1000
adducts/cell) was found in liver and kidney DNA, whereas low levels of adducts were
present in brain DNA. In these studies the ‘old’ rats were no older than 10 months.
However, using the same assay, Gaubatz observed an approx. 10-fold increase of such
aromatic adducts in the heart of old compared with young mice: from about 1200 per cell
in 2-month-old mice to about 15 000 per cell in 39-month-old mice581. At present the
identity of the I-spots is still not known, although they do not appear to co-migrate with
any known carcinogen-induced DNA adduct. They may be induced via metabolically
activated exogenous carcinogens or stem from metabolically formed, possibly hormone-
associated, endogenous electrophiles.
Oxidative lesions For the detection of small base damages, such as alkylation damage
and oxidative damage, in cell culture systems after treatment with mutagens, HPLC has
proved to be a method of choice. However, the quantitative determination of base dam-
age in cells and tissues of animals is quite a different matter, due to the relatively low level
at which such lesions are present and the multiple potential artifacts that can confound
the results.
Bruce Ames and co-workers, because of their interest in ROS as a major cause of aging
and cancer, were the ﬁrst to report quantitative estimates of oxidative DNA lesions, most
notably 8-oxoG, in tissues and urine of laboratory rodents245. They used HPLC with elec-
trochemical detection, which is about 3000-fold more sensitive than standard UV detec-
tion. As mentioned already, their initial estimates of the level of 8-oxoG, probably the
main oxidative base lesion, were one or two orders of magnitude too high due to artiﬁcial
oxidation products during sample preparation. Later, Hamilton et al., using similar
methods, reported 8-oxoG levels in rat tissues to vary from 0.01 to 0.03 lesions per 105
guanines503. Most notably, an age-related increase of about 2–5-fold was observed in all
tissues studied. These workers also measured 8-oxoG in mtDNA and found the level of
the lesions to be 3–4-fold higher than in nuclear DNA,which conﬁrms the original results
obtained by Richter et al.538 (see above), although the total amounts of lesions and the
magnitude of the differences found by Hamilton et al. were much smaller. Most notably,
an age-related increase of about 2–5-fold was observed in all tissues studied.Also,8-oxoG
in mtDNA from liver was found to increase with age by about 2-fold. As reported by the
authors, these ﬁndings indicate that the nuclear genome of the brain of a young mouse
would contain a steady-state level of 180 8-oxoG lesions compared with 640 8-oxoG
194
THE AGING GENOME

lesions for an old mouse. Interestingly, this relatively low number of lesions found for the
young animals is very similar to an estimate made by others using a quantitative model
based on knowledge of endogenous formation rates and repair mechanisms of the
lesion582.
Whereas age-related increases in 8-oxoG have been reported by others as well, and also
in other species, such as houseﬂies583 and human muscle biopsy specimens584, others
either did not ﬁnd any age-related increase or reported such an increase for some but not
all tissues585,586. Hence, the main conclusion from all these studies appears to be that the
level of this particular lesion is very low in the ﬁrst place and that if there is an increase
with age then it is not by very much. In fact, dramatically high levels or considerable
increases with age of this highly mutagenic lesion would be unexpected in view of the efﬁ-
cient repair mechanisms available,in both the nucleus and mitochondria.As we have seen
in Chapter 4, there is also no reason to assume that repair activities for this lesion decline
dramatically with age. The same may actually apply to less frequent types of oxidative
DNA damage. For example, Le et al.587 reported fewer than 4.3 thymine glycols per 109
bases of DNA in cultured cells.
6.1.2.3 Cross-links
As mentioned in Chapter 4, interstrand DNA cross-links are extremely toxic forms of
DNA damage, which need to be removed through complicated HR-based pathways in
combination with other repair systems, such as NER. Defects in such pathways, as engi-
neered in the mouse, result in a dramatic premature aging phenotype (Chapter 5). This is
not surprising because an interstrand DNA cross-link can prevent separation of DNA
strands and therefore completely block DNA replication or transcription. The sources of
endogenous interstrand DNA cross-links are poorly characterized,and the importance of
their repair for normal cellular processes is not clear outside of the clinic, where agents to
induce interstrand DNA cross-links, such as mitomycin C and cisplatin, are widely used
as antitumor agents. The same is true for DNA–protein cross-links, which can also cova-
lently bind the two strands together and are induced by antitumor chemotherapeutic
agents. Potential sources of spontaneous DNA–DNA and DNA–protein cross-links are
the aforementioned oxygen radicals and AGEs. In addition, UV and ionizing radiation
can induce cross-links under certain conditions.
Whereas a cross-linking theory of aging was postulated in the 1940s588 and the cross-
linking of proteins is still regarded as a major mechanism of aging at the molecular level
(see Chapter 7), only few data are available on the age-dependency of the level of inter-
strand DNA–DNA cross-links and DNA–protein cross-links403. DNA–DNA cross-links
can be measured in a variety of ways including gel electrophoretic mobility, alkaline
elution, relative thermal stability, or template activity. With highly puriﬁed liver DNA
from rats or mice, no age-related difference in thermal stability or template activity was
THE AGING GENOME
195

found589,590. These ﬁndings suggest the absence of an age-related increase in DNA–DNA
cross-linking. However, by using crude preparations from rat and mouse liver Russell
et al.589 found an age-related increase in thermal stability and a decrease in template
activity,suggesting that there is an age-related increase in the level of DNA–protein cross-
linking.
Several authors have reported an age-related increase in protein–DNA cross-links in
various tissues of rodents, usually measured by determining the fraction of DNA bound
to protein591–593. The number of such lesions present at any given time in the DNA of the
genome is unclear at present, but unlikely to be extensive because of their toxicity and the
availability of sophisticated repair systems. Nevertheless, their role as a major form of
aging-related spontaneous DNA damage cannot be ruled out
6.1.3 DNA DAMAGE: A LIKELY CAUSE OF AGING?
From the above we can conclude that although the rate of DNA damage induction is very
high, steady-state levels of the most frequently occurring lesions are only modest.
Whereas absolute ﬁgures of tens of thousands of lesions induced in cells each day suggest
a very serious problem, it is difﬁcult to see how steady-state levels of a few lesions per 106
undamaged bases can contribute to the adverse effects that develop during the course of
the aging process. At such low frequencies, with lesions continuously removed through
DNA-repair pathways and re-introduced, it would be unlikely for a lesion to reside in a
gene or its regulatory regions long enough to have adverse effects. It seems a reasonable
conclusion that DNA damage per se, even in the large absolute numbers of lesions
induced in cells each day, is unlikely to play a direct role in causing age-related functional
impairment and disease. However, there are at least three scenarios, not mutually exclu-
sive, that may be able to explain how DNA damage could signiﬁcantly contribute to
aging-related cellular degeneration and death.
First, whereas steady-state levels of each of the variety of lesions thus far investigated
may be low in normal tissues, such levels can be greatly increased as a consequence of dis-
ease. For example, ischemia-induced neuronal injury in animal models is accompanied
by increased levels of 8-oxoG and AP sites594,595.Increased levels of DNA damage have also
been associated with Alzheimer’s disease596,597 and diabetes598. According to this scenario
DNA damage would not be a primary driver of the aging process but associated with
aging-related diseases. However, even in such cases there is no evidence that steady-state
levels rise high enough to exert a direct effect.As yet there is no consensus about a possible
role of spontaneous DNA damage in the etiology of disease599.
Second, DNA damage could occur predominantly in certain areas of the genome, in
so-called hotspots with a high chance of affecting gene expression. We have already seen
how the proteins involved in DNA higher-order structure may also provide protection
196
THE AGING GENOME

against genotoxic agents. DNA damage is more likely to be induced in nucleosome-free
regions than in the highly compact heterochromatin. Interestingly, in 2004, Lu et al.600
described the age-related reduction in expression of a set of genes in the brain of human
individuals,varying in age from 26 to 106 years.To test whether this decreased expression
could be due to the accumulation of spontaneous oxidative DNA damage in the pro-
moter regions of these genes, they used formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg),
an enzyme that recognizes 8-oxoG as well as formamidopyrimidines (see the section on
BER in Chapter 4). Lu et al. used this enzyme to generate SSBs, which in turn render the
DNA resistant to PCR ampliﬁcation. Originally discovered by Ben van Houten (Research
Triangle Park,NC,USA),DNA lesions,including oxidative damage such as strand breaks,
base modiﬁcations,and AP sites,will block the progression of the polymerase in the PCR,
resulting in a decrease in ampliﬁcation of a target sequence.He and his co-workers subse-
quently used this as a measure of the amount of these lesions601. In this case, it would be a
measure of the amount of 8-oxoG,with the ratio of intact PCR products in cleaved versus
uncleaved DNA, determined using quantitative PCR, as a measure for the amount of
damage in a speciﬁc DNA sequence.In these experiments Lu et al. 600 observed an almost
complete loss of intact DNA in 500-bp fragments from the promoter regions of genes that
showed reduced expression in brain samples from individuals over the age of 70; the
reduction was much less in promoters of non-downregulated genes or in the exon regions
of all genes.
In the FPG assay, an almost complete loss of intact DNA would correspond to an aver-
age of one lesion in the 500-bp PCR nuclear DNA fragment. If human brain is not signif-
icantly more sensitive to oxidative DNA damage than mouse brain, the aforementioned
results of Hamilton et al. indicate 0.41 8-oxoG lesions per 106 dGs in brain of old mice503.
Assuming a GC content of 40%, this would correspond to approx. 104 lesions per 500-
bp fragment. Hence, the almost complete loss of intact DNA observed by Lu et al. would
correspond to an overrepresentation of 10 000-fold in promoter regions of genes down-
regulated with age.
Andrew Collins (Oslo,Norway),who has critically reviewed this ﬁeld537,concludes that
for human cells the background level of 8-oxoG is between 0.3 and 4.2 8-oxoGs per 106
dGs. The data from Hamilton for aged mouse brain cited above are on the low side of this
range. Taking the highest value of 4.2 lesions per 106 dGs, and again assuming a 40% GC
content, this would correspond to fewer than 103 lesions per 500-bp fragment, still an
overrepresentation of 1000-fold. Whereas 8-oxoG may make up only about 5% of all
oxidative lesions, it is highly unlikely that FPG would recognize them all. Indeed, accord-
ing to Collins,FPG mainly recognizes 8-oxoG and the total number of FPG-sensitive sites
in normal human cells is not higher than 0.6 per 106 dGs,rather lower than the 4.2 lesions
per 106 dGs used in the above calculation.Hence,also according to this more conservative
scenario, the overrepresentation of 8-oxoG observed by Lu et al. in promoter sites of
upregulated genes in old human brain is remarkably high: at least 1000 times.
THE AGING GENOME
197

The implications of these ﬁndings are far-reaching. If spontaneous DNA damage is so
selective, then we need to reassess current conclusions that the risk to human health from
endogenous oxidative DNA damage has been seriously overstated. Moreover, these
results suggest that the accumulation of spontaneous oxidative DNA damage is sufﬁcient
to causally explain the aging process in the human brain. For the moment we will need to
await further conﬁrmation of these observations.
Finally, DNA damage can have long-term adverse effects through mutagenesis.
Whereas extraordinarily efﬁcient in resisting the avalanche of chemical changes threaten-
ing the genome’s integrity at any given moment, DNA-damage processing has not
evolved to a level of perfection that would allow essentially no errors. Errors are being
made and while their frequency may be remarkably low compared with the large num-
bers of lesions induced in our genome every day, mutations may easily accumulate to a
level where they might exert adverse effects. In contrast to chemical changes in the DNA
double helix, mutations are not recognized by the cell’s DNA-damage-processing system
and will be just as faithfully replicated as the original, correct sequence. This is why muta-
tions are irreversible and cannot be removed, except through cell-elimination ‘repair’. Do
mutations accumulate in different organs and tissues of mammals,and,if so,what kind of
mutations accumulate and can they have adverse effects?
6.2 DNA-sequence changes
Unlike DNA damage, which can be recognized and repaired through one of the pathways
in the network of genome-maintenance and -repair systems, DNA mutations (as well as
epigenomic errors) are irreversible. This makes them a true molecular endpoint of the
aging process. In Chapter 4 I indicated the various opportunities for DNA mutations to
arise. Even in the absence of DNA damage, tautomeric shifts can lead to base-pair substi-
tutions during DNA replication or repair synthesis. In the presence of DNA damage,
mutations can arise as a consequence of translesion synthesis. Small deletions or inser-
tions are often associated with defects in mismatch repair and large chromosomal
rearrangements can occur after mistakes made during DSB repair. As yet we know very
little about possible mechanisms of ‘epimutations’.
DNA mutations are expected to occur at a much lower frequency than DNA lesions.
However, since in contrast to DNA damage, sequence alterations cannot be repaired, their
accumulation can only be prevented through cell elimination, for example, through the
apoptotic response.As we have seen, it is likely that such cellular responses come into play
predominantly after extensive DNA damage, such as high temporary exposure to geno-
toxic agents,or the bursts of free-radical damage thought to be associated with phagocyto-
sis.Therefore,whereas there is evidence that tissues from old individuals are characterized
198
THE AGING GENOME

by increased spontaneous apoptosis as well as increased numbers of senescent cells
(Chapter 7), it is likely that the majority of cells in a tissue will remain intact and may only
suffer from a gradually increased mutation load.
Even more than DNA damage, DNA-sequence changes have been found difﬁcult to
detect in cells or tissue samples from humans or animals. Hence, whereas the ﬁrst somatic
mutation hypothesis of aging was presented as early as 1958506, it is only recently that
robust methods for measuring genomic mutation loads in cells and tissues from both
humans and animals have become available.It should also be kept in mind that the interest
in DNA damage and mutations has mainly been driven by the discovery that such events
are the cause of cancer. Tumors are clonal derivatives of usually only one cell and charac-
terized by widespread DNA-sequence alterations as compared to the normal tissues from
which they arise.This explains why it has been so much easier to detect genome alterations
in tumors than in normal tissue. The latter is essentially a mosaic of cells, each with a dif-
ferent spectrum of genomic alterations. Below I will summarize the different types of
genome alteration that can occur in cells of animal tissues and the evidence that they accu-
mulate with age in vivo, and brieﬂy discuss the likelihood that such changes could con-
tribute to the aging phenotype. Whereas I will focus on mammalian systems, in this case
also because most of our knowledge in this ﬁeld relates to mammals, recent evidence of
genomic instability during yeast aging will also be presented.
6.2.1 CYTOGENETIC CHANGES
Cytogenetic changes are genomic alterations that can be visualized by light microscopy in
cells, usually during metaphase. They include chromosomal aberrations, abnormalities
in the structure or number of chromosomes, and extrachromosomal fragments, such as
the extrachromosomal rDNA circles that accumulate in yeast during replicative aging
(Chapter 2).A proportion of chromosomal aberrations are unstable and give rise to chro-
mosome fragments without spindle-attachment organelles (kinetochores, centromeres;
see Chapter 3). These are termed acentric fragments.When the cell divides, some of these
fragments are excluded from the main daughter nuclei and form so-called micronuclei
within the cytoplasm, either on their own or in conjunction with other fragments. Stable
chromosomal aberrations in germ cells are often responsible for genetic disorders. As we
have seen in Chapter 1,chromosomes have been studied for more than a century.However,
it was only in 1956 that the number of chromosomes in a human diploid cell was deter-
mined to be 46 (22 pairs of autosomes and two sex chromosomes)602.Several years later the
presence of an extra chromosome 21 was discovered in people with Down’s syndrome as
well as sex-chromosome anomalies in patients with sexual-development disorders.
Individual chromosomes can be identiﬁed in metaphase through staining with different
compounds, such as Giemsa or quinacrine, which yield differentially stained regions on
THE AGING GENOME
199

chromosomes.The banding patterns appear related to base composition and chromosome
loop structure. In this way stains can distinguish between, for example, non-centromeric
regions and centromeres. The patterns of bands are found to be speciﬁc for individual
chromosomes and they allow their distinction as well as the recognition of structural
abnormalities or aberrations. Cytogenetic analysis is now an integral diagnostic proce-
dure in prenatal diagnosis. It is also utilized in the evaluation of patients with mental
retardation, multiple birth defects, and abnormal sexual development, and in some cases
of infertility or multiple miscarriages. Cytogenetic analysis is also useful in the study and
treatment of cancer patients since tumor cells generally contain many chromosomal
abnormalities with often a particular type of aberration characteristic for a certain type of
cancer. An example is the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia, the
ﬁrst consistent chromosome abnormality identiﬁed in cancer. This is an abnormally
short chromosome 22 that results from the reciprocal exchange of DNA between this
chromosome and chromosome 9603. This translocation takes place in a single bone-
marrow cell and, through the process of clonal expansion, gives rise to leukemia. Apart
from translocations, the types of chromosomal abnormality that can be detected by
cytogenetics are numerical aberrations, duplications, deletions, and inversions.
The late Howard Curtis (1906–1972) and co-workers used cytogenetic analysis to pro-
vide the ﬁrst evidence for an increasing level of genome alterations in a somatic tissue
during aging in vivo604. For this purpose, Curtis and Crowley looked at the main cell type
in the mouse liver, parenchymal cells or hepatocytes, which normally do not divide.
However, surgical removal of part of the liver results in regeneration through hepatocyte
proliferation. When inspecting parenchymal cell metaphase plates after this so-called
partial hepatectomy these workers found considerably higher numbers of cells with
abnormal chromosomes in old animals than in young animals (from about 10% of the
cells in 4–5-month-old mice to 75% in mice older than 12 months).
Later, such large structural changes in DNA—aneuploidy, translocations, and
dicentrics—were routinely observed to increase with donor age in white blood cells (which
can be stimulated to divide after their transfer into culture) of human individuals; that is,
from about 2–4% of the cells carrying chromosome abnormalities in young individuals to
about six times more than this in the elderly. It is conceivable that these chromosomal
changes reﬂect changes in the hematopoietic stem cells. The recent use of more advanced
methods,such as chromosome painting (see Chapter 3),have amply conﬁrmed the increase
in cytogenetic damage with age in lymphocytes from both humans605 and mice606. Also,
spontaneous micronuclei were demonstrated to increase with age in human lymphocytes607.
Hence there is currently universal consensus that the frequency of cytogenetic changes
in both human and mouse cells increases with age. In lymphocytes, which is still the only
cell type readily accessible for such determinations, the frequency of cells carrying one or
more of such abnormalities does not appear to rise much higher than approx. 10%.

THE AGING GENOME

However, it should be realized that even with the more recently emerged chromosome-
painting methods, the smallest possible type of aberration that can still be detected is
2 million bp.Based on the early work of Howard Curtis,the frequency of cytogenetic alter-
ations may be higher in non-dividing cells, but in the absence of independent conﬁrma-
tion of these results it is difﬁcult to draw conclusions.However,one type of chromosomal
aberration—aneuploidy—has been recently found in postmitotic tissues as well.
Aneuploidy is so widespread in tumors that there is probably no tumor that,upon analy-
sis, does not appear to depart from diploidy. Aneuploidy can have major adverse effects
through so-called loss of heterozygosity (LOH) due to the loss of one chromosome
copy. LOH can have other causes, as we have seen in Chapter 4. However, the gain of a
chromosome copy can also adversely affect cellular physiology, as is evident from Down’s
syndrome, which is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21. Many characteristics of cancer
are now explained by aneuploidy, through gene-dose effects, which can greatly alter the
networks that underlie cellular function.
In the mouse embryo it has been demonstrated that over 30% of neural progenitor
cells display chromosomal aneuploidy, both loss and gain of chromosomes608. This high
frequency of chromosomally aberrant neurons was also found in normal human brain
using interphase ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (or FISH) with probes for chromo-
some 21609. Studies of aneuploidy in postmitotic organs (without the need for
metaphases) have become possible through the use of interphase ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization. Using speciﬁc probes one can now simply count if in a cell there are two or
more copies of a given chromosome (loss of a chromosome is more difﬁcult to measure).
Chromosome 21-aneuploid cells,including non-neuronal cells and neurons,were shown
to constitute about 4% of the estimated 1 trillion cells in the human brain. Since only one
autosome was analyzed it is likely that the overall percentage of aneuploidy in the brain is
much higher than that. This is in striking contrast with the situation in human lympho-
cytes in which only 0.6% of the cells were chromosome 21-aneuploid. Routine karyotyp-
ing in both human and mouse lymphocytes revealed aneuploidy in only about 3% of
such cells. Whereas it is not known whether the frequency of aneuploid cells in the brain
increases with age (but see below), the high numbers of aneuploid cells already in the
brain of adults indicate that our genome is much less stable than often thought.
A frequent consequence of aneuploidy is cell death.However,the widespread occurrence
of aneuploidy in tumor cells already indicates that cell death is by no means inevitable.
Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that aneuploid neurons are functionally active
and normally integrated in brain circuitry610. This, together with the many other types
of random genome alterations that have been demonstrated in somatic cells, leads to
genetic mosaicism in the cells and tissues of an individual during development and aging.
One may ask whether this genetic mosaicism contributes to individual physiological and
behavioral variation,for better or for worse.Thus far this question remains unanswered,but
THE AGING GENOME
201

recent studies provide some compelling evidence that large-scale genomic variation is
compatible with life and is more common than thought previously. For example, apart
from the single-nucleotide polymorphisms, of which there have been over 10 million
deﬁned in the human genome, large-scale copy-number polymorphism has been
observed among individuals611,612 and is thought to greatly contribute to genomic diversity
and disease susceptibility613. However, this is germ-line genetic variation, with its effects
subject to selection.Whereas it is certainly possible that some random genomic alterations
contribute positively to certain complex physiological functions, such as those encoded in
brain circuitry, it is reasonable to expect adverse effects in most cases. This issue, as to how
stochastic alterations can have a consistent effect on function, is of major interest for the
question that is central in this book:how could random genomic alterations lead to a series
of consistent physiological changes that ultimately bring life to a close?
Before I move to the next type of genomic alteration it is important to mention some
observations in mice that suggest that chromosomal aberrations in neuronal stem cells
accumulate during aging, eventually affecting almost all such cells. It is now generally
accepted that vertebrates use stem-cell reservoirs for tissue replacement. For most of the
past century it was thought that the adult brain was unable to generate new neurons, but
that turned out to be wrong. The adult brain contains a population of multipotent self-
renewing cells: stem cells. Stem cells do not usually divide, but when they do the result is
always a replacement stem cell and a rapidly dividing progenitor cell.In the previous chap-
ter we saw how genomic integrity of the replacement stem cell can be maintained by
template-strand retention,suppression of mitotic recombination,and increased apoptosis.
Neural stem cells can be expanded in culture in the form of cellular aggregates, termed
neurospheres, with each neurosphere descending from one neural stem cell. However,
some of such neurospheres can be derived from neural progenitor cells,which have limited
self-renewal capacity and more restricted lineage potential614.Stephen Pruitt (Buffalo,NY,
USA) and co-workers analyzed such neurospheres from C57Bl/6DBA/2 hybrid mice at
nine chromosome pairs for genomic areas of structural loss by making use of known sin-
gle-nucleotide polymorphisms between these two mouse strains615. At such polymorphic
loci, the loss of one allele indicated LOH. It was found that whereas in 15 neurospheres
from young mice no deletions were detected, 16 out of 17 neurospheres from old animals
displayed LOH on one or more chromosomes. The results of this elegant study are
especially interesting since they indicate the accumulation of chromosomal mutations in
stem or progenitor cells, a potential reservoir for cell-based therapies of aging-related
degeneration. The impact of aging-related mutation accumulation, even in stem cells, on
possibilities for intervention to delay and reverse aging-related decline,will be discussed in
Chapter 8.
In summary, cytogenetic studies have demonstrated convincingly that the frequency of
chromosomal aberrations increase with age in white blood cells,in both humans and mice.
In such cells only a minor portion of the cells, even at old age, is affected. Since alterations
202
THE AGING GENOME

affecting fewer than about 2 million base pairs are still undetectable with current methods,
it is possible that at old age all cells carry one or more chromosomal alteration.More recent
results indicate that chromosomal aberrations, especially aneuploidy, are widespread in
brain cells. Little is known about chromosomal aberrations in other postmitotic cells, with
exception of the early results from Curtis on aging liver.
6.2.2 GENE MUTATIONS
6.2.2.1 Endogenous selectable marker genes
The frequency of inactivation of speciﬁc genes in cells and tissues of animals is difﬁcult to
measure in an objective manner since this would require the re-sequencing of thousands
of copies of that gene isolated randomly from the DNA of that tissue. With the develop-
ment of tests based on selectable endogenous target genes,it became possible to assess the
mutant frequency at these loci among cells taken from a human or animal and cultured
on a medium that selects against the wild-type cells.There are now a number of such tests
available, with the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus test the most
widely used616. HPRT converts the free purine bases, guanine and hypoxanthine, into the
corresponding nucleoside phosphate and thus makes them available for the synthesis of
nucleic acids. Selection of mutants is based on the differing degrees of toxicity of the
synthetic purine base 6-thioguanine for mutant compared with non-mutant cells.In cells
with functional HPRT, 6-thioguanine is converted into toxic nucleotides, with the result
that the cells die. Loss of HPRT activity results in resistance to 6-thioguanine. The HPRT
gene is located on the X chromosome in both humans and mice.Hence,when inactivated
there is no spare copy of the gene available. Heritable mutations inactivating the HPRT
gene cause Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects males. Males with
this syndrome develop physical handicaps, mental retardation, and kidney problems.
Although the in vivo function of HPRT, even at the cellular level, cannot be ignored (see
below) its inactivation has no apparent consequences for cells growing in culture,because
it functions merely in a salvage pathway; with few exceptions, organisms are able to syn-
thesize purines and pyrimidines de novo.
Using this test, Richard Albertini (Burlington, VT, USA) and Alec Morley (Adelaide,
Australia) were the ﬁrst to report spontaneous mutations in human lymphocytes617,618.
Interestingly, a substantial fraction of these spontaneous mutants appeared to be genome
rearrangements: large mutations, such as deletions, inversions, and ampliﬁcations619.
Different investigators have now also shown that mutation frequencies at the HPRT locus
increase with donor age. The results indicate that mutation frequencies in humans
(expressed as the number of mutated cells as a function of the total number of cells, cor-
rected for the plating efﬁciency) increase with age,from about 2  106 in young individ-
uals to about 1  105 in middle-aged and old individuals620.In mice mutation frequencies
THE AGING GENOME
203

have been reported from about 5 106in young animals to about 3 105in middle-aged
mice621 or old mice622. However, in both mice and humans these values could be underes-
timates. To some extent this is likely due to a certain selection against mutant cells both
in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, 6-thioguanine may not only eliminate wild-type cells, but
also a number of genuine HPRT mutants. In vivo, HPRT mutant frequencies have been
found to decrease with time following exposure to mutagenic agents, such as ethyl
nitrosourea and radiation623. This can be explained by selection against HPRT mutant
cells that lack the purine-salvage pathway. Another more general reason why observed
mutation frequencies at selectable target loci are underestimates is that large genome
rearrangement events could affect not only the target gene, but also neighboring genes
essential for survival of the cell.
The HPRT method is also insensitive for certain types of mutation. This has become
apparent from studies with other reporters.For example,Grist et al.624 used the HLA gene
as a marker by selecting cells that had lost a particular HLA antigen due to mutation
among human lymphocytes.The results indicated two- or three-times higher mutant fre-
quencies than obtained with the HPRT assay. The additional mutations were ascribed to
mitotic recombination events that remain undetected by the HPRT assay, which lacks a
homologous chromosome. This important role of mitotic recombination in generating
spontaneous mutations was conﬁrmed by work using yet another reporter locus, the
adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) gene. The product of this gene catalyzes a
similar salvage reaction as HPRT, but then with adenine. Cells lacking APRT are resistant
to toxic adenine analogs, such as 2,6-diaminopurine, allowing their selection in vitro.
However,this gene is on an autosome,both in humans and mice.Using a mouse model in
which one copy of the Aprt gene was eliminated, work from the laboratories of Peter
Stambrook and Jay Tischﬁeld revealed mutation frequencies in lymphocytes and ﬁbrob-
lasts from these animals as high as 1  104 342.Most of the mutations appeared to be LOH
due to mitotic recombination events. As mentioned in Chapter 4, these same investiga-
tors later showed that the mutation frequency at the Aprt locus in mouse ES cells is signif-
icantly lower than that in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts or in adult cells in vivo410. Mitotic
recombination in ES cells appeared in particular to be suppressed and chromosome loss,
which after reduplication leads to uniparental disomy (two copies of the same chromo-
some from one parent and no copy from the other), represented more than half of the
LOH events.
In mice subjected to caloric restriction, the only intervention demonstrated to
increase lifespan in mammals (Chapter 2), Hprt mutation frequencies were found to
increase with age at a signiﬁcantly slower rate than in the animals fed ad libitum621.These
results were independently conﬁrmed in rats by Aidoo et al.625, and suggest that the level
of accumulated somatic mutations reﬂects biological rather than chronological age.
This conclusion was further strengthened by the results of Odagiri et al.435,mentioned in
Chapter 5,who demonstrated accelerated accumulation of Hprt mutations in peripheral
204
THE AGING GENOME

blood lymphocytes of so-called senescence-accelerated mice (SAM). Although the SAM
model is not generally accepted as a mouse model of accelerated aging (Chapter 5),these
ﬁndings nevertheless demonstrate a link between somatic mutation rate and physiolog-
ical decline.
Interestingly,the HPRT test has been used to determine the frequency of mutant primary
tubular epithelial cell clones grown directly from kidney tissue from 2- to 94-year-old
human donors. The mutation frequencies found were more than 10-fold higher than in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and also increased with age, from about 5  105 to about
2.5  104 626. Renal tubular epithelial cells perform critical, secretory and resorptive
tasks in the kidney and are normally quiescent. It is possible that the observed mutation
frequencies are even underestimates, since not all cells in the kidney specimens had the
ability to grow into clones, which may well be due to a very high mutation load. The high
mutation frequency in the kidney cells could reﬂect a relatively slow turnover compared
with T cells, but it is more likely that there is less stringent selection against mutant cells
in vivo.In this respect,it is conceivable that the HPRT mutant frequencies in lymphocytes
are underestimates because of a high stringency of selection in these cells.
6.2.2.2 Transgenic reporter genes
At the end of the 1980s, when I was ﬁnishing my PhD work, the lack of a suitable mam-
malian model system to measure gene mutations in vivo begun to be felt. In spite of its
usefulness,the HPRT selective assay is limited to cell types that can still actively proliferate
in culture. At this time, the age of transgenic mouse modeling had begun and I designed
a mouse model harboring in all its cells the lacZ bacterial reporter gene as part of a bacte-
rial DNA virus, a so-called bacteriophage 
 vector. The use of a bacteriophage 
 vector
was inspired by results published at that time by Peter Glazer (New Haven, CT, USA),
indicating that such a construct could be recovered from its integrated state in the
genomic DNA of mouse L-cell lines using 
 in vitro packaging extracts627. Such extracts
contain all the components needed to excise the vectors from the genomic DNA at the 
so-called cos sites and subsequently package them into viral capsids to produce infectious

 phage. Subsequent infection of E. coli is then highly efﬁcient.
The ﬁrst Mutamouse, as it was later called, was constructed by my then PhD student
Jan Gossen (now at Organon, Oss, The Netherlands) and born in 1988. Unfortunately,
once we tried to recover the integrated vectors from the mouse genomic DNA in E. coli,by
using a variety of commercial packaging extracts, the efﬁciency appeared to be close to
zero.To us this was puzzling in view of the results of Peter Glazer.The explanation turned
out to be the mechanism of host restriction by which E. coli K12 strains manage to get rid
of foreign DNA methylated at CpG sites. (The original positive results of Glazer et al. can
possibly be explained by hypomethylation of their mouse cell lines.) Later,we understood
that scientists from Stratagene, the company making a ﬂourishing business out of selling
THE AGING GENOME
205


 packaging extracts which are routinely used in genetic cloning experiments, had taken
the same approach. Like us they had been stuck at the recovery stage.
When we looked at the packaging extracts obtained from Stratagene we suspected that
these were derived from E. coli C, a strain known to be host-restriction-negative628. This
could explain why these extracts worked so well compared with other commercially avail-
able ones. However, the plating cells were E. coli K12. Apparently, workers at Stratagene
had not realized the importance of the K12 restriction modiﬁcation, which prevented
high-efﬁciency rescue of bacteriophage 
 methylated in the mouse at CpG sites. When
testing Stratagene packaging extracts, but now with E. coli C as plating cells, one morning
our large 25  25 cm plates appeared full of beautiful blue plaques with an occasional
white one, indicating a lacZ gene mutated in the mouse629. This ﬁrst mouse model for
mutation detection in vivo was described in 1989630.
A second model,developed by Jay Short and co-workers at Stratagene,was presented in
1991631. Their model, named BigBlue, differed from ours in that it harbored not the lacZ
but the lacI gene as a mutation reporter gene. The lacI gene is part of the E. coli lac operon
and encodes the DNA-binding protein called the lac repressor, which inhibits the expres-
sion of lacZ by binding to the so-called operator, a short region of DNA that lies partially
within the promoter. In this system, inactivation of the lacI gene results in de-repression
of the lacZ gene and, hence, the detection of mutants as blue plaques among many color-
less ones. This was a signiﬁcant improvement over our own model since we had to look
through thousands of blue plaques to ﬁnd the occasional colorless ones. Fortunately,
quickly thereafter we developed a positive selection system based on the use of E. coli C
strains rendered deﬁcient in the galE gene632.Such cells use the 
-galactosidase product of
the lacZ gene to convert lactose or lactose analogs into UDP-galactose, which is toxic and
normally further metabolized into UDP-glucose. Since the galE-deﬁcient strains can no
longer perform this function they will die upon receipt of an intact lacZ gene. Hence, in a
way that is very similar to the HPRT system we could now positively select for lacZ
mutants.
Whereas the positive selection system worked well with the bacteriophage 
-based
Mutamouse system633, we later generated another system based on lacZ as part of a plas-
mid rather than a bacteriophage 
 system. After our initial studies with the Mutamouse
we had begun to realize that the only type of mutation that we detected was base-pair
substitutions or very small deletions or insertions.Similar results were obtained by others
who either worked with our lacZ mouse or with Stratagene’s lacI mouse. This was strange
because results obtained with the aforementioned HPRT assay and other endogenous
selectable marker genes clearly indicated that a signiﬁcant portion of spontaneous muta-
tions were sizable genome rearrangements. In part, this could be explained by the fact that
rearrangements, such as large deletions, will go undetected as a consequence of the mini-
mum vector size required for efﬁcient packaging of bacteriophage 
 vectors (i.e. between
42 and 52 kb).In addition,genome rearrangements involving the mouse ﬂanking regions
206
THE AGING GENOME

and therefore one of the cos sites cannot be detected (Fig. 6.4). It was not clear, however,
why virtually no deletion mutations of moderate size—between 50 and 3000 bp—could
be detected with the 
 mouse models. It is possible that the large amount of prokaryotic
DNA in the 
 models inhibits the activity of those DNA-processing systems that in mam-
mals are involved in generating mutations,including DNA rearrangements.This unnatu-
ral DNA substrate could also explain the similarity of the mutation spectra between
different organs in the phage models, which we observed and later also reported on with
the lacI system. We did not expect this lack of tissue speciﬁcity in view of the profound
differences in cellular function and environment and, consequently, in sources of geno-
toxic stress. The long stretch of prokaryotic DNA comprised by multiple copies of the 
50-kb-long bacteriophage 
 vector could essentially behave in a prokaryotic way and
constrain the generation of a mutation spectrum representative for the mammalian
organism. Indeed, both our own lacZ-based Mutamouse and Stratagene’s lacI-based

models for mutation analysis. In the two most commonly used

copies of the 50-kb 
 vectors are integrated head to tail. They can be excised from genomic DNA
and packaged into phage heads using commercially available packaging extracts. Each individual
phage results in a plaque on a lawn of E. coli cells, but only if the lacZ gene is inactive due to a
mutation. The lacZ plasmids are only about 5 kb in size and present in about 20 copies per hap-
loid mouse genome. Plasmids need to be separated ﬁrst from mouse genomic DNA before they
can be used to transform E. coli cells. Each individual plasmid results in an E. coli colony, but only

BigBlue model harbored a stretch of 40 copies (per haploid genome) of the 50-kb-long
bacteriophage 
 vector. This would amount to 2 million bp of prokaryotic DNA.
The plasmid system subsequently made by Jan Gossen in my laboratory634 and later
more fully validated by Martijn Dollé635,636, ﬁrst a student and then a postdoctoral
researcher in the laboratory, contained only 20 copies of an approx. 5-kb plasmid, which
does not amount to much more than 100 000 bp of prokaryotic DNA. The reason that
initially plasmid vectors had not been used as the vector of choice for transgenic mutation
models is the notoriously low transformation efﬁciencies obtained with plasmids excised
from their integrated state in the mammalian genome. Efﬁcient intramolecular ligation
of excised plasmids requires extensive dilution and the presence of the genomic DNA will
also negatively inﬂuence the transformation efﬁciency. By contrast, bacteriophage rescue
is a highly efﬁcient process. We greatly improved the efﬁciency of plasmid rescue by ﬁrst
separating the excised plasmids from the mouse genomic DNA. For this purpose, we ﬁrst
collect the plasmids with magnetic beads coupled to the LacI repressor protein, which
binds very tightly to the operator region in the lacZ gene. After washing away the mouse
genomic DNA, the pure lacZ plasmids are transferred into E. coli by electroporation.
Figure 6.4 compares the 
 and plasmid rescue procedures.
A distinct advantage of the lacZ-plasmid system over the bacteriophage 
 systems is its
capability to detect genome rearrangements with one breakpoint in a lacZ gene and the
other elsewhere in the mouse genome (Fig. 6.5). Excision with the restriction enzyme
HindIII (just outside the lacZ gene) would then result in a truncated plasmid attached to a
piece of mouse DNA from the breakpoint to the ﬁrst HindIII site in the mouse genome.
This can be on the same chromosome (in case of a deletion or inversion) or on another
chromosome (in case of a translocation). The mouse DNA fragment cloned in the lacZ
mutant plasmid is generally small because HindIII cuts rather frequently in the mouse
genome. It is possible to physically characterize such mutants by sequencing the mouse
DNA fragment. Searching the mouse genome sequence (which is completely known) for
this fragment quickly yields the identity of the breakpoint. Hence, the lacZ plasmid sys-
tem is able to detect a broad spectrum of mutations, including large genome rearrange-
ments. However, it cannot detect them all. Homologous (mitotic) recombination, for
example, leading to deletion of entire reporter-gene copies (LOH) is a frequent muta-
tional event, as indicated by the results obtained with the Aprt mice, but goes undetected
in all transgenic assays.
By now, a number of mice equipped with transgenic reporter genes have been made.
In most of these models the location of the reporter gene does not appear to inﬂuence
the mutation frequencies, with some exceptions. For example, we made one lacZ trans-
genic line with the bacteriophage 
 vectors integrated near the pseudoautosomal region
of the X chromosome and found spontaneous somatic and germ-line mutation frequen-
cies that were up to a hundred times higher than in all other lines tested637. Somewhat
later Peter Glazer’s group also identiﬁed a mouse line, with the integrated 
 vectors on
208
THE AGING GENOME

chromosome 7, in which the frequency of spontaneous mutations was unusually high:
20-fold higher than in other transgenic mice carrying a similar number of vectors at
other chromosomal locations638.
With the development of transgenic mouse models harboring chromosomally inte-
grated reporter genes, it became possible to directly test the hypothesis that somatic
mutations in a neutral gene accumulate with age in different organs and tissues.Using the
lacI mouse model, Lee et al.639 were the ﬁrst to demonstrate an age-related increase in
mutant frequency (expressed as the number of mutant reporter genes as a function of the
total number of recovered reporter genes) in spleen,from about 3  105 in mice of a few
weeks old to (1–2)  104 in 24-month-old animals. Shortly thereafter, in my own labo-
ratory, Martijn Dollé demonstrated age-related increases in the mutation frequency in
some, but not all, organs in the mouse. For example, Dollé demonstrated that mutation
frequencies at a lacZ transgene increase with age in the liver, from about 4  105 in the
young adults to about 15  105 in old animals (about 30 months), whereas such an
increase was virtually absent in the brain640. Also spleen,heart,and small intestine showed
increased mutation frequencies with age641,642, but not the testes643. These organ-speciﬁc
patterns of mutation accumulation at the lacZ transgene locus488 are shown in Fig. 6.6.

the recovery of internal copies plus the 3’ mouse ﬂanking copy. The 5’ copy cannot be recovered

mids because it disrupts amp, which cannot be regenerated by ligation in case of a mouse ﬂank-

The organ-speciﬁc mutation accumulation observed in the lacZ-plasmid mice appeared
to be very similar to that obtained by others.For example,Tetsuyo Ono (Sendai,Japan) and
co-workers used the original bacteriophage 
 mouse model made by Jan Gossen in my lab-
oratory. They also observed an age-related increase of lacZ mutation frequency in liver,
heart,and spleen,but virtually no increase in brain and testes644.Also Stuart et al.,analyzing
the mutation frequency in liver, brain, and bladder of lacI mice, observed a tissue-speciﬁc
aging-related pattern, with mutations accumulating in liver, more rapidly in bladder, but
not in brain645.Also using the lacI reporter mice, Hill et al. analyzed spontaneous mutation
frequency in middle to late adulthood of the mouse, at 10, 14, 17, 23, 25, and 30 months of
age in adipose tissue, liver, cerebellum, and male germ cells646. These authors observed
elevation of the mutation frequency with age in adipose tissue and liver, but not in cerebel-
lum or male germ cells, thereby extending and conﬁrming the tissue speciﬁcity mentioned
above.Mutation accumulation in male germ cells at the lacI locus in the mouse was studied
in the laboratory of Christi Walter (San Antonio, TX, USA). Interestingly, an initial decline
in mutation frequency was observed during spermatogenesis,with a subsequent increase in
spermatogenic cells obtained from old mice647. The mutation frequencies eventually
obtained in old mice were similar to the ones obtained in the aforementioned studies (at
either young or old age). Whereas several laboratories reported a generally lower sponta-
neous mutation frequency in both brain and male germ cells646,there seems to be consensus
that in these tissues there is no increase with age (or a very small one). Hence, it is possible
that these investigators were able to accurately measure lacI mutations at much lower levels
than others,in which case the aging-related increase escaped detection by other investigators.

Fig. 6.6 Spontaneous lacZ mutant frequencies with age in brain, testis, spleen, liver, heart, and
small intestine of the lacZ-plasmid transgenic mice. The lines represent hand-drawn curves
matching mean mutant frequencies at different age groups. The survival curve of these mice, set
to 100% at birth, indicates 50% survival at 26.5 months of age. This was not different from non-
transgenic control animals of this strain. Re-drawn with permission from ref. 488.

As mentioned above, bacteriophage 
 models do not indicate a profound organ or
tissue speciﬁcity with respect to the spontaneous mutation spectra. By contrast, in the
lacZ-plasmid model, with its approx. 20-fold smaller concatamer, Martijn Dollé in my
laboratory observed striking organ speciﬁcity with respect to the mutational spectra of
the old animals. Mutations in the lacZ reporter mouse model can be characterized by
restriction digestion and nucleotide sequencing of the positively selected lacZ-mutant
plasmids recovered from a mouse tissue.Mutations that do not alter the restriction pattern
are point mutations—single base changes or very small deletions. Mutations that cause
changes in the restriction pattern are deletions and other types of rearrangement. Only a
few of these were deletions within the lacZ gene. Most of these mutations appeared to
involve genome rearrangements between the lacZ-plasmid cluster and the mouse
chromosomal DNA. As mentioned, such events can be physically characterized based
on the small mouse fragment that indicates the breakpoint in the mouse genome.
Already, by simply separating mutations on the basis of whether or not they changed the
restriction-enzyme pattern in these two classes,striking organ speciﬁcities were observed.
For example, as shown in Fig. 6.7, whereas in heart and liver both point mutations and
genome rearrangements were found to accumulate, in small intestine the age-related
increase was entirely due to point mutations641.
Further characterization of the point mutations by nucleotide sequencing of entire
mutant lacZ genes obtained from different organs at young and old age indicated that
initially, at young age, the mutation spectra were more or less the same for all organs.
However, during aging they started to diverge signiﬁcantly, resulting at old age in drastic

differences between organs, with a high frequency of GC to AT base-pair substitutions at
CpG sites in postmitotic organs, such as brain and heart, and a more varied pattern in the
more proliferative tissues275.Especially in brain and heart of old animals,GC to AT transi-
tion mutations at CpG sites were dominant. As mentioned in Chapter 4, such mutations
are a typical consequence of the spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine.
Further characterization of the genome rearrangements also required nucleotide
sequencing. Whereas some conclusions could be drawn about the nature of such muta-
tions based on the restriction patterns, characterization of the breakpoint in the mouse
genome allowed their identiﬁcation as deletions,inversions,or translocations.Such phys-
ical mapping of 49 genome-rearrangement mutations, mainly from heart and liver of
young and old mice, indicated intrachromosomal deletions or inversions, varying from
smaller than 100 kb to 66 Mb, as well as translocation events648. A signiﬁcant increase in
the frequency of these genome rearrangements with age was found in heart and liver, but
not in brain. Assuming that the lacZ plasmid reporter locus is representative for the
overall genome, Martijn Dollé in my lab extrapolated the genome rearrangement
frequencies from the 3-kb lacZ transgene to the entire 6  109-bp diploid genome. The
outcome was subsequently divided by a factor of two, because only one of the two break-
points needs to occur in a lacZ reporter gene. The results indicate that up to 37 (in the
aged heart) genome rearrangements can accumulate in an aged cell648.
There are multiple explanations for organ speciﬁcity in the rate of mutation accumulation
and the type of mutations found during the course of the aging process.A most logical one is
that the mutation frequency is simply a function of organ-speciﬁc cell-proliferative activity.
Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that with higher proliferative activity there is a higher
chance of replication error, one of the major mechanisms of mutation generation (see
above). This could explain the relatively high mutation frequency in small intestine, which
increases about 5-fold during aging641. It does not explain, however, the relatively low age-
related increase in spleen, and the absence of an increase in testes; both these organs should
contain plenty of actively proliferating cells.If proliferative activity alone is important,then it
is also not clear why mutations accumulate in heart,a postmitotic organ par excellence.
To resolve at least some of these issues,Ana Maria Garcia,a postdoctoral researcher in my
laboratory, investigated the possibility of intra-organ variation in the two tissues that were
most dissimilar in terms of mutation accumulation: the highly proliferative small intestine
and the postmitotic brain. By separating the inner part or mucosa of the intestine, which
mainly contains the rapidly dividing epithelial cells,from the outer part or serosa,a layer of
postmitotic, smooth muscle cells, she was able to directly compare the lacZ mutation fre-
quency between proliferating and non-dividing cells in this organ from 18-month-old
mice. The results indicate signiﬁcantly higher mutation frequencies in the highly prolifera-
tive mucosa than in the serosa (Fig. 6.8). Most of the mutations in the mucosa were point
mutations, suggesting replication errors as their source. However,Ana Maria also observed
a signiﬁcant increase in lacZ mutation frequency in the serosa, underscoring the fact that
DNA replication is not strictly necessary for mutations to accumulate with age.
212
THE AGING GENOME

With respect to the brain, Garcia was interested in the possibility that while in the
overall organ mutations were not (or only slowly) accumulating, certain sub-structures
could nevertheless show increased mutagenesis with age. Indeed, when subdividing
different brain parts,she observed that in the hypothalamus and hippocampus mutations
were accumulating with age with the mutation frequency higher than in the brain overall
at all ages (Fig.6.9).Therefore,factors other than DNA replication errors,possibly closely
related to the function of a particular organ or sub-structure, are likely to play a role in
determining the patterns of genomic instability as they arise during aging. As we will see
in Chapter 7, work from another member of my laboratory, Rita Busuttil, convincingy

demonstrates that mutations do not need replication for their induction. It all depends
on the type of mutation.
6.2.2.3 Summary
In summary, using both endogenous selectable marker genes and bacterial reporter trans-
genes,strong evidence has been provided for the age-related accumulation of spontaneous
mutations in mammals. The results indicate organ and tissue speciﬁcity of the mutation
frequencies and the results obtained with the lacZ-plasmid model also indicate organ
speciﬁcities of the types of mutation that were accumulating. In interpreting these data it
should be noted that the observed increases were modest (varying from less than 2-fold,to
little more than 4-fold) and appeared to level off at middle age (Fig. 6.6). This leveling off
was found by multiple investigators using different mutation target genes and can be
explained to a large extent by a rapid early increase in mutations649. This pattern contrasts
with the previously mentioned age-related increase in chromosomal anomalies, which is
exponential606. However, the variation between individuals, even in inbred mice, is large,
which constrains any deﬁnite conclusions regarding the kinetics of mutation accumula-
tion.It should also be noted that none of the currently available systems are sensitive for all
types of mutation and it is therefore likely that the real mutation frequency is signiﬁcantly
higher. Most of the transgenic models also do not account for mutational hotspots and
such important functional endpoints as cell death are missed. Indeed, to put the results on
mutant frequencies of different organs and tissues at various age levels into context, it will
be necessary to also assess cell proliferation and cell death. Most importantly, it will be
necessary to determine at some point the critical level of cellular mutation loads in terms
of physiological consequences.This will be further discussed in Chapter 7.
6.2.3 POTENTIAL HOTSPOTS OF DNA MUTATIONS
Thus far, I have described the results obtained with assays measuring genomic instability
at sequences thought to be representative for the genome overall. However, as discussed
in Chapter 3, the genome consists of different types of sequence, some of which have par-
ticular characteristics that could make them either unusually prone to muta-
tion or lend a mutational event an extraordinarily high functional relevance. Below I will
discuss such potential genomic hotspots of mutation.
6.2.3.1 Telomeric instability
A genetic instability hotspot that has received a lot of attention is the telomere. Telomere
shortening, due to the loss of minisatellite repeat elements, has been observed to occur
during repeated passaging of human cells in culture.As we have seen,this causes replicative
214
THE AGING GENOME

senescence and in the absence of p53 leads to crisis. This latter stage is characterized by
chromosomal aberrations, dominated by end-to-end fusions. The importance of telom-
erase in preventing this is underscored by the observation in the laboratories of Woody
Wright and Jerry Shay (both in Dallas, TX, USA) that its reconstitution prevents replica-
tive senescence and essentially immortalizes normal human cells650. Also in view of the
important role of replicative senescence as an in vitro model of normal aging, this is
generally interpreted as strong evidence for telomerase as a major and perhaps the most
important genome-stability system in actively proliferating human cells. Its potential
importance for aging in vivo is underscored by the observation of premature aging of
mice with an inactivated telomerase RNA component (see Chapter 5) and a number of
functional studies, which will be discussed in the next chapter.
As mentioned in Chapter 4, in the genetic disorder dyskeratosis congenita, telomere
shortening is accelerated,and patients have premature onset of many age-related diseases
and early death651. Is there any evidence for telomere attrition in vivo to the extent that it
can be considered as a major cause of aging, for example, through increased replicative
senescence? Telomere length can be measured as the mean length of terminal restriction
fragments, which involves a standard genomic Southern blot with terminal restriction
fragments detected by hybridization to a probe containing telomeric repeats. Whereas
alternative methods allowing the measurement of single telomeres were later devel-
oped652,653, most data on telomere length during aging were obtained with analysis of
terminal restriction fragments. Average telomere length in white blood cells and other
tissues of humans have been measured by a number of groups and found to decline from
approx. 12.2 kb in a fetus to 7.2 kb in a 72-year-old654–656. The greatest loss was found to
occur at relatively young age. No individuals have been found with a mean telomere
length of less than 5 kb, even among 100-year olds655,656.
More recently, using a quantitative PCR method in a study of 143 normal unrelated
individuals over the age of 60 years, an association was found between telomere length in
blood and mortality657. However, this was not conﬁrmed in a later study involving 598
normal individuals over 85 years658. Whereas it is therefore questionable whether telom-
ere attrition by itself has phenotypic consequences in vivo, it should be kept in mind that
average telomere length in blood is not the same as the average length of telomeres in an
individual cell or the shortest telomere of an individual chromosome.Hence,even if aver-
age telomere length is not a predictor of survival, telomere loss could nevertheless be one
of many different forms of genomic instability contributing to normal aging, in this
speciﬁc case, for example, by resulting in an increased number of senescent cells.
6.2.3.2 mtDNA mutations
The 16.5-kb mitochondrial genome has been implicated as a major target for somatic
mutations during aging659. According to the mitochondrial theory of aging somatic
mutations in mtDNA accumulate with age as a consequence of the free radicals generated
THE AGING GENOME
215

so close to their target.The resulting degenerative changes in this important cell organelle
are then expected to result in impaired function of the respiratory chain, leading to
increased free radical production and more mutations. The logic of this vicious cycle has
appealed greatly to gerontologists and explains the importance assigned to the mtDNA as
a target for age-related mutations. However, as we shall see, recently obtained results shed
some doubt on vicious-cycle ideas.
The main reasons to consider the mitochondrial genome as an important target for
aging-related spontaneous DNA mutations are its physical proximity to a major source of
free radicals, the lack of protective histone proteins, and the presumed absence of
mtDNA-repair systems.As we have seen in Chapter 4, this last point turned out not to be
entirely correct; several repair pathways have been described for mtDNA,most notably an
efﬁcient BER system, and possibly also mismatch repair and recombinational repair660.
Nevertheless, as noted earlier in this chapter there is evidence for a relatively high suscep-
tibility of mtDNA to oxidative DNA damage. Apart from their increased vulnerability to
DNA damage, mitochondria are the key organelles for respiration through electron
transfer and oxidative phosphorylation,arguably the most important cellular function in
eukaryotes.
Encoded by the mitochondrial genome are two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and genes encoding
13 mitochondrial protein subunits.They are necessary to produce essential enzyme com-
plexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation.However,most mitochondrial components
are encoded in the nuclear genome.What is the evidence that mutations in the mitochon-
drial genome accumulate to a level that starts contributing to aging-related cellular
degeneration and death?
Within human populations, the mitochondrial genome has a high rate of sequence
divergence with multiple polymorphic variants. This has led to its major role as a tool for
examining human evolutionary history. mtDNA is inherited exclusively through the
mother and a number of human heritable diseases are caused by speciﬁc mutations in the
mitochondrial genome. These mutations typically impair oxidative energy metabolism,
causing such aging-related diseases as cardiomyopathy and neurodegeneration. Somatic
cells contain hundreds (epithelial cells) to hundreds of thousands (cardiomyocytes) of
copies of the mitochondrial genome per cell and disease-causing mutations are often
present in only a fraction of the total. This situation is called heteroplasmy.A mutation is
called homoplasmic when it is carried by all copies of the mitochondrial genome.Usually
the clinical severity of the disease is correlated with the proportion of the mutated
mtDNA in the target tissues. There is a threshold above which a disease phenotype
becomes apparent661. This threshold may be 60% for deletions and as high as 90% for
point mutations. Similar to the situation with nuclear DNA mutations, deletions have a
higher impact because they affect a larger part of the mitochondrial genome. However,
the possibility cannot be excluded that physiological effects manifest at frequencies of
deleted mitochondrial genome copies as low as 20%.
216
THE AGING GENOME

For somatic mutations arising with age the situation is very similar to the mitochon-
driopathies.Somatic mtDNA deletions increase with age in a tissue-speciﬁc manner487.In
particular, muscle, heart, and brain accumulate relatively high levels of deleted mtDNA.
Intra-organ variation has been demonstrated for the brain, with an accumulation in the
cortex, but not in the cerebellum662. Hence, this situation is highly reminiscent of what
has been observed for nuclear DNA with the lacZ reporter mice, in which similar striking
inter- and intra-organ variation in mutation accumulation has been observed (see
above). Also in this case, the question is whether or not the observed mutation frequen-
cies can lead to physiological consequences. For the nuclear genome this question cannot
really be addressed at this stage, but the mitochondrial genome is much smaller and rela-
tively easily accessible due to its high copy number per cell. Nevertheless, measuring
mutations in the mitochondrial genome remains technically challenging.
Before a mutation can have a phenotypic consequence, it must ﬁrst clonally expand.
There is now ample evidence that mitochondrial mutations not only accumulate with
age, but can also clonally expand to reach levels that may be physiologically signiﬁcant.
Like so many studies aiming to detect and quantitate low-frequency events, in this ﬁeld
one has to be extremely cautious in interpreting the work that has been done. Most assays
are based on PCR,which is notoriously prone to artifact.Some of the best work in analyz-
ing mtDNA mutations in aging is from the laboratory of Konstantin Khrapko (Boston,
MA, USA), who developed a PCR-based method to scan signiﬁcant parts of mitochondr-
ial genomes from single cells663.Using this assay he demonstrated that in human cardiomy-
ocytes from old but not from young donors, mtDNA deletions occur at a frequency of
about one in 15 cells664. In such cells deleted mtDNA copies represented up to 65% of the
total number of copies, although in most cells this fraction was much less.
Excellent work in this ﬁeld has also been done by the groups of Doug Turnbull
(Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) and Judd Aiken (Madison, WI, USA). Turnbull’s group was
the ﬁrst to demonstrate mtDNA deletion mutations in muscle ﬁbers from normal elderly
subjects with very low activity of cytochrome c oxidase (a marker of respiratory-chain
deﬁciency),suggestive of a mtDNA defect665.Aiken’s group observed clonality of deletion
mutations in the mitochondrial genome in defective muscle ﬁbers in aged rats666 and rhe-
sus monkeys667. Hence, in the case of muscle there is concrete evidence that mtDNA dele-
tions may actually cause defects in oxidative phosphorylation. Recent data from
Khrapko’s laboratory, using a novel single-molecule PCR approach, indicate high frac-
tions of deleted mtDNA in cytochrome c oxidase-deﬁcient neurons in the substantia
nigra of elderly humans668.
For point mutations the situation is more complicated because such mutations are
more difﬁcult to detect. Using a similar single-cell PCR approach, Khrapko’s group
sequenced about 5% of the mitochondrial genome in a number of cells from tissues as
diverse as buccal epithelium and heart muscle obtained from donors of different
ages669. They discovered that many cells contained high proportions (varying from about
THE AGING GENOME
217

30 to 100%) of clonal mutant mtDNA expanded from single initial mutant mtDNA
molecules. Virtually all expanded mutations were observed in tissues from elderly. They
concluded that in an aged human body, there is on average approximately one expanded
mtDNA point mutation per cell.
Rather than postmitotic cells, such as cardiomyocytes or muscle ﬁbers, Turnbull’s
group analyzed intestinal colonic crypts, clonal populations of cells derived from one or
two stem cells, for mtDNA mutations670. They sequenced the entire mitochondrial
genome from individual colonic crypts obtained by laser microdissection from elderly
individuals. Pathogenic point mutations were detected in most but not all of the
cytochrome c oxidase-deﬁcient crypts. Since the frequency of such crypts increased with
age these ﬁndings support a more general role of mtDNA mutations, including point
mutations, in aging.
In summary, the accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial genome, both dele-
tions and point mutations,in aging human tissues has been demonstrated conclusively.It
also seems highly likely that through the expansion process at least some of these muta-
tions reach physiological signiﬁcance. The question remaining is whether enough of
these highly penetrant mutations accumulate with age to causally contribute to aging in a
substantial fraction of cells in a tissue.While this still remains to be demonstrated, it does
seem clear that the original vicious cycle of mtDNA mutations leading to respiratory
defects, which in turn increase ROS production, thereby causing increased mutagenesis,
is unlikely to be true. Indeed, when more free radicals would generate new mutations one
would not expect the clonality described above and observed by multiple investigators.
Moreover, as already described in Chapter 5, the POLG-defective mitochondrial mutator
mice display greatly increased mtDNA mutation rates but no increase in oxidative
stress490. Nevertheless, although a direct link between mtDNA mutations and physiologi-
cal consequences in aging tissue has not been established, the association—by multiple
research groups—of such mutations with respiratory defects implicates the mitochondr-
ial genome as a major functional target of the aging process.
6.2.3.3 Repeat-element loci
The families of repeat elements that are such a major component of the mammalian
genome are also recognized mutational hot spots. Before I discuss the nature of the vari-
ous forms of instability and the evidence that mutations at these loci accumulate with
age, it is important to mention the potential role of some of these repeat families in the
regulation of gene-expression patterns. As early as 1969, Roy Britten (Corona del Mar,
CA, USA) and Eric Davidson (Pasadena, CA, USA) proposed that networks of dispersed
DNA repeats, thereby focusing on transposons, coordinate the expression of batteries of
genes involved in development671.As we have seen, there is evidence that both the mobile
genetic elements (mainly retrotransposons) and simple, tandem repeat loci are unstable.
218
THE AGING GENOME

Such instability would allow rapid evolutionary change at the level of gene regulation
rather than through protein structural alterations.Whereas, as yet, evidence has emerged
for networks of miRNAs that act as additional layers of gene regulation there are no con-
sistent data pointing towards a role of the main repeat families in the genome; that is,
retrotransposons and tandem repeats. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that age-related
instability of these sequences has adverse effects on normal patterns of gene regulation.
As described in Chapter 3, there are two major families of retrotransposons, termed
LINES and SINES,with L1 and Alu,respectively,as their main representatives in humans.
L1 repeats, the only active human mobile element, encode the machinery to move both
itself and Alu, which is much shorter and does not contain an open reading frame. The
capability of such elements to retrotranspose has been demonstrated in human cell
lines672. The recently obtained evidence for both expression and retrotransposition of
L1 elements in mouse neural progenitor cells in the brain as well as in such cells in vitro
has also been discussed in Chapter 3192. There was some evidence that L1 insertion
occurred preferentially in or near genes with an effect on differentiation of the neural
progenitor cells. It has not been possible to accurately determine the frequency of the
insertion events, which may vary from one in 10 to one in 1000 cells. Hence, there is no
unambiguous evidence yet that they contribute signiﬁcantly to somatic instability and
nothing is known about a possible increase in transposition activity with age.The authors
suggested that the observed L1 transposition could positively contribute to brain plastic-
ity, but in my opinion it is more likely that such events would contribute to the random
accumulation of mutations in the genome to possibly exert adverse effects. Indeed, over-
expression of L1 proteins leads to toxicity673 and L1 is able to induce a p53-dependent
apoptotic response674. Of note, L1 is preferentially expressed in the germ line. Its lower
overall expression level in somatic cells may be a consequence of methylation673. We will
later see that there is evidence for a general demethylation of genomic DNA sequences
during aging in a variety of tissues, which may contribute to increased instability of L1
elements with age, but this is unknown at present. Indeed, to my knowledge there are no
studies that have been focused on instability of this type of repeat family during aging.
The second group of potentially unstable repeat elements comprises tandemly
repeated DNA loci, which include the well-known minisatellites and microsatellites. In
general mutation frequencies at these loci are about 1000-fold higher than the aforemen-
tioned mutational reporter genes, including HPRT and the transgenic reporter loci675.
Classic hypervariable minisatellites, as originally characterized by Alec Jeffreys (Leicester,
UK)676, have germ-line mutation rates varying from 0.1 to 15% per transmission in
humans677. These values were obtained by comparing minisatellites in blood DNA
between parents and offspring or by direct analysis of these loci in sperm. Whereas it is
probable that a high proportion of minisatellite mutations occur during meiotic recom-
bination,they could actually occur at any point after fertilization,during development and
aging. The situation is somewhat similar for microsatellite germ-line mutation rates, but
THE AGING GENOME
219

it should be noted that mutation rates are highly locus-speciﬁc, depend greatly on the
length of the allele, and may differ between humans and mice. Germ-line mutation rates
at a single locus can vary by as much as three orders of magnitude for alleles within the
normal range, but on average remain much higher than rates of mutation in the genome
overall. Indeed, minisatellites and microsatellites are the most unstable loci in the human
genome. Mutations in these sequences can arise during meiosis in the germ line, but they
are not restricted to meiosis and also occur during development and (as we will see)
aging. As already indicated in Chapters 3 and 4, microsatellite instability is probably a
result of slippage replication errors, but minisatellite mutations may arise as a conse-
quence of recombination processes, such as unequal crossing-over.
To study the effect of radiation on the tandem repeat loci, germ-line minisatellite
mutation rates have been evaluated in four irradiated groups of human individuals from
Japan and the former USSR675.The results were somewhat variable,but in general suggest
that minisatellite instability is increased in people exposed to radiation. This is similar to
the results obtained when mice were exposed to radiation678.
Studies of microsatellite instability have been restricted mainly to tumor DNA,in which
mutation rates at these loci can be so high (for example, in case of defective mismatch
repair; see Chapter 4) that mutant fragments can simply be detected as a different PCR
product after ampliﬁcation of the locus from total tumor DNA.Age-related microsatellite
instability has also been reported in normally aged tissues, most notably human T
lymphocytes679. However, the results of these studies, in which individuals were scored
qualitatively as to the presence or absence of a microsatellite-instability phenotype,are not
very reliable due to the difﬁculties in analyzing bulk DNA from normal tissues680. This is
complicated because in spite of the high mutation rates at microsatellite loci as compared
with the overall genome, they are still too low to be detected directly in bulk DNA from
normal cells. Analysis in such cases is somewhat complicated by the tendency of the Taq
polymerase used in the PCR to undergo slippage, which leads to a characteristic stutter
band pattern. It is not possible to dissect such complex banding patterns to derive truly
quantitative mutation frequencies. Alternatively, so-called small-pool PCR, in which
multiple aliquots of a dilution of the DNA sample (from one to 100 genome equivalents)
are subjected to PCR ampliﬁcation, with the products separately analyzed to discover
mutant fragments,dramatically increased the sensitivity of detection.Using this approach
it has been possible to analyze microsatellite instability in normal constitutive tissues and
detect mutant fragments. A high degree of automation has further facilitated the routine
application of this method to study microsatellite instability during aging.
Results from a recent study in which blood DNA from 17 normal individuals of a vari-
ety of ages was analyzed by small-pool PCR at six microsatellite loci indicated an age-
related increase from 1% in 20–30-year-old individuals to 4% in 60–70-year-olds681.
While of great interest as a symptom of aging,it is difﬁcult to judge at this stage the poten-
tial functional consequences of microsatellite instability. Some microsatellite loci are
220
THE AGING GENOME

contained within coding regions and others may affect gene regulation682, but most are
probably not functionally relevant.
Another type of repeat family for which age-related changes has been reported is the
tandemly repeated rRNA genes. Already as early as 1972 work from the late Bernard
Strehler (1925–2001) and co-workers indicated instability of these genes683. Analyzing
DNA from different tissues of beagle dogs of different ages,as well as human heart-biopsy
samples, these investigators reported a loss of hybridizable rRNA gene copies with age. In
the beagle dogs such a gene copy loss was only found for postmitotic tissues: muscle,
brain, and heart684. These results were not conﬁrmed in a later study by Peterson et al.,
studying mouse heart685. This will also remind the reader of work in Leonard Guarante’s
laboratory on rRNA gene instability in aging yeast, giving rise to extrachromosomal
rDNA circles (Chapter 2). Brad Johnson (Philadelphia, PA, USA), then in Guarente’s lab-
oratory, investigated the possible occurrence of rDNA circles in various human tissues
(heart, kidney, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle) from donors aged 4 days to 84 years.
Evidence for such signs of rDNA instability was not obtained. The same was true for
human and mouse colon crypts. There was also no evidence for changes in rDNA copy
number with age in the same human tissues, although the number of individuals was
small and individual variation large (B. Johnson, personal communication).
Interestingly,in later studies from several different laboratories evidence was obtained for
an age-related decline in rRNA gene activity in ﬁbroblasts and lymphocytes from human
individuals of different ages686,687.
6.3.4 MUTATIONS IN GERM CELLS
The level of genomic instability in germs cells is of special interest for somatic mutation
theories of aging. As discussed multiple times, mutations in the germ line are a necessary
evil to guarantee evolvability: the generation of individual variation that permits the
perpetuation of life when circumstances change. A question that has been raised in the
past is how mutation accumulation in somatic cells can cause aging while the germ line is
apparently immortal. The answer is 2-fold. First, germ cells may have superior genome-
maintenance systems to keep mutation loads relatively low. This is illustrated by results
from Olsen et al.688, indicating more efﬁcient BER activities in human and rat male germ
cells than in white blood cells. As we have seen, stem cells are also likely to have superior
genome-maintenance systems (Chapter 4). Second, and more importantly, germ cells
(and to some extent also stem cells) have the opportunity to get rid of genetically damaged
cells through selection.
Even superior genome-maintenance systems are unable to completely prevent muta-
tion accumulation and it is generally assumed that an age-related increase in chromoso-
mal abnormalities and other types of mutations in parental germ cells is responsible for
THE AGING GENOME
221

increased risk of offspring with a genetic defect,such as Down’s syndrome689.Chromosomal
abnormalities, including aneuploidy and chromosome structural rearrangements, occur
in 10–20% of spermatozoa and oocytes690.At least 15% of all recognized human pregnan-
cies abort, most likely as a consequence of chromosomal mutations691. In fact, 50% of all
spontaneous abortions contain a gross chromosomal mutation. An age-related increase
in the number of sperm with chromosomal breaks, translocations, and aneuploidy has
also been observed in mice692.
The germ-line mutation rate in males is generally much higher than in females, which
was ﬁrst established by J.B.S. Haldane, who was also the one to ﬁrst estimate the human
mutation rate693. This higher paternal mutation rate is now ascribed to the much larger
number of germ-cell divisions173.As discussed, replication errors are an important factor
in the generation of mutations, although not the only one. It is therefore not surprising
that most mutations causing genetic disease are derived from the father. This can be
determined for sporadic cases of the disease using polymorphic markers linked to the dis-
ease gene. Disease incidence increases dramatically with age, most likely because muta-
tions accumulate in the germ cells as they do in somatic cells. Interestingly, in all such
cases the mutation is a point mutation, possibly because they are almost all small genes
and rearrangements, such as deletions, could remove the entire gene, leading to early
lethality. However, no such paternal effect is observed for heritable diseases caused by
mutations in very large genes. In such genes the disease-causing mutation is often a large
deletion173. As we shall see in Chapter 7, Rita Busuttil in my laboratory, working with
somatic cells from our lacZ-plasmid reporter mice, observed a striking replication
dependency for point mutations, but not for large deletions and genome rearrangements
in general.
The picture that emerges of the germ line is that of an effective sieve that allows most
mutations to be lost by negative selection; that is, through the death of germ cells or early
embryos. Apoptosis may play an important role in eliminating defective cells from the
germ-cell pool. In somatic tissues such a sieve as a mechanism to select against cells ren-
dered dysfunctional by mutations could also be present, but is destined to be less effective
because cell death itself would lead to functional decline. Indeed, aging of somatic tissues
can be considered as a continuous battle between maintaining genomic integrity and
ensuring sufﬁcient cell-functional mass. In a recent publication with my colleague,Yousin
Suh (San Antonio,TX,USA),we called this the zero sum game of aging694.Altering the bal-
ance between cell survival and cell elimination can cause an increase in either cancer or
non-cancer degenerative symptoms of aging,as we have seen in the previous chapter.Only
by improving the processes that prevent genome deterioration without the need for cell
elimination can we expect to alter the zero sum game and signiﬁcantly extend lifespan
(Chapter 8).
With the recently emerged possibility of cloning mammals by transferring nuclei from
adult somatic cells into enucleated oocytes,it should be possible to directly investigate the
222
THE AGING GENOME

functional consequences of genome deterioration with age. Indeed, the success rate of
cloning animals from somatic cells of old individuals should be markedly lower.Although
the results thus far obtained with cloned animals suggest that cloning is less efﬁcient from
cells of adult animals as compared with fetal or embryonal cells, it is difﬁcult to draw
conclusions from the relatively small number of cloned animals obtained from somatic
nuclei of adult animals. There are no systematic studies in which different age groups
were compared side-by-side with respect to the efﬁciency of cloning from somatic nuclei.
Whereas fetal cells may have much less genetic damage than adult somatic cells, the suc-
cess rate of cloning using any cell type is very low. However, this may largely be due to
technical problems or problems of genomic reprogramming by oocytes rather than the
accumulation of mutational damage in adult somatic cells695–698.
Some anecdotal results are notable. In one study, somatic-cell cloning technology was
used to produce eight newborn calves from a 16-year-old, infertile bull699. Whereas bulls
have a maximum lifespan of about 30 years, this result would certainly not suggest that at
middle age somatic mutation accumulation with age is so high that it leaves not a single
cell with an intact genome. In reality it merely indicates that one can still ﬁnd a cell with a
genome sufﬁciently intact to successfully direct development of a new calf. On the other
hand, there is some evidence for signs of premature aging in the ﬁrst cloned sheep,
including premature telomere shortening700. Finally, in an interesting series of experi-
ments mice have been cloned from cumulus cells (small cells that develop in the ovary
and support the growth of oocytes) from several successive generations of cloned mice701.
The sequentially cloned mice showed no signs of premature aging,at least up to 1.5 years,
when they were studied. However, to put this in perspective, only about 2% of enucleated
oocytes receiving a cumulus cell generally develop to live-born pups, a cloning efﬁciency
which appeared to drop in successively cloned generations701. Hence, selection for muta-
tion-free cumulus nuclei (which are extremely young anyway) cannot be excluded.
Apart from the well documented higher incidence of abnormal reproductive outcome
among older parents, as discussed above, there is one report describing an effect on the
lifespan of their offspring. Gavrilov et al.702 studied the effect of paternal age on human
longevity in European aristocratic families with well known geneology. Interestingly,
these workers found a signiﬁcant adverse effect of having an older father (50–59 years) on
daughters, who lived on average 4.4 years less than daughters of young fathers (20–29
years). No signiﬁcant effect was found for sons.
6.3 Changes in DNA modiﬁcation and conformation
Thus far,most studies of genome alterations in aging have focused on DNA damage (chem-
ical changes) or mutations (sequence changes). However, more and more attention is now
THE AGING GENOME
223

focused on another source of phenotypic variation that is not based on variations in the
base sequence of DNA.Such so-called epigenetic variation is heritable information encoded
by modiﬁcations of genome and chromatin components that affect gene expression.As we
have seen in Chapter 3, the structural basis for epigenetic variation involves DNA methyla-
tion or histone-modiﬁcation patterns. Epigenetic information is only partially stable and
destined to change during development and in carrying out essential somatic functions.
Hence, it would not be surprising if stochastic changes in the epigenome turned out to be
more relevant as a potential cause of aging than DNA sequence changes.Epigenetic patterns
of transcription control have now been conclusively shown to be essential in the regulation
of gene expression (Chapter 3). After embryogenesis, when epigenetic patterns are erased
and reset,development and differentiation are largely facilitated by epigenetic programs382.
Random changes in these patterns are genuine mutations and likely to have adverse effects,
similar to changes in DNA sequence. Called epimutations by Robin Holliday (Sydney,
Australia)703, they have now been demonstrated to be critically important as causal factors
in cancer704.Attention has thus far been focused on changes in methylation at cytosines,pri-
marily in CpG dinucleotides of promoter regions. Of special interest in this respect are so-
called CpG islands, which are usually unmethylated in normal cells. Hypermethylation can
silence tumor-suppressor genes, thereby facilitating tumor formation. However,
hypomethylation can also contribute to cancer, for example, by facilitating genomic insta-
bility705.Epigenomic alterations are now also increasingly recognized as part of aging and its
associated pathologic phenotypes706,707.Early evidence indicated a general demethylation in
most vertebrate tissues with aging708. In mitotically active tissue, it is possible that this
reﬂects some deﬁciency in maintenance remethylation as this normally occurs after DNA
replication.As discussed in the previous section,such a general demethylation during aging
may desuppress silenced retrotransposons,such as L1,to increase genome instability.
Genome-wide demethylation has been suggested to be a step in carcinogenesis, based
on the results of a study suggesting that defects in DNA methylation might contribute to
the genomic instability of some colorectal tumour cell lines709. Evidence that supports
this notion comes from another study in which elevated mutation rates were found at
both the endogenous Hprt gene and an integrated viral thymidine kinase (tk) transgene
in mouse embryonic stem cells nullizygous for the major DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1)
gene. Gene deletions were the predominant mutations at both loci. The major cause of
the observed tk deletions was either mitotic recombination or chromosomal loss accom-
panied by duplication of the remaining chromosome710. These results suggest that the
role of methylation may include the suppression of genomic instability.This may be espe-
cially important in repeat-rich genomic regions, to prevent illegitimate recombinations.
Whether the observed hypomethylation in aged tissues also promotes genomic instability
is unknown at present. A similar approach cannot easily be taken to study hypomethyla-
tion in vivo since Dnmt1 nullizygosity is embryonically lethal. For this purpose, it will be
necessary to construct hypomorphic alleles for this gene.
224
THE AGING GENOME

Most studies on the role of methylation in aging have focused on speciﬁc genes or their
promoter regions. In early approaches, including some studies by my own laboratory711,
pairs of so-called isoschizomeric restriction enzymes were used. Such enzymes recognize
the same site except when this is methylated,in which case one of the pair is no longer able
to digest the sample. The best example is the restriction enzyme pair HpaII and MspI,
which both recognize CCGG.The former is sensitive to CpG methylation,but the latter is
not. Southern-blot analysis using speciﬁc probes then allows the assessment of these sites
in or around the gene of interest by comparing hybridization patterns. More recently,
sequence-speciﬁc methods have been developed utilizing the sequence differences
between methylated alleles and unmethylated alleles that occur after sodium bisulﬁte
treatment712. DNA is modiﬁed by sodium bisulﬁte treatment converting unmethylated,
but not methylated, cytosines to uracil. Comparison of modiﬁed with unmodiﬁed sample
by sequencing, or using a PCR test with speciﬁcally designed primers, will distinguish
methylated from unmethylated DNA in bisulﬁte-modiﬁed DNA.
There are now numerous reports in the literature on changes in methylation status of
individual genes during aging713. However, the functional relevance of these changes is
largely unknown. This situation is different for cancer, in which hypermethylation has
been associated with the silencing of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, tumor-cell
invasion,DNA repair,apoptosis,and cell signaling704.Similar to mutations that inactivate
these genes through DNA-sequence alterations, hypermethylation provides tumor cells
with a growth advantage, allows them to metastasize, and increases their genetic instabil-
ity, which will allow them to acquire further advantageous genetic changes. The target for
such hypermethylation events are the CpG islands located in gene promoter regions.
Methylation of CpG islands is strongly correlated with transcriptional suppression. As
mentioned in Chapter 3,CpG islands are generally unmethylated in normal somatic cells.
As discussed in that chapter, the changes in chromatin structure resulting from hyperme-
thylation would effectively silence transcription. By now, the methylation status of CpG
islands of a large number of genes in many tumors has been assessed using a method
called restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS)714.RLGS is a genome-wide method
based on two-dimensional separation of DNA fragments obtained by NotI digestion,
which is methylation-sensitive.
RLGS has been used in the laboratory of Bruce Richardson (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) to
investigate whether CpG islands change methylation status during aging715. After com-
paring more than 2000 loci in T lymphocytes isolated from newborn, middle-aged, and
elderly people, the conclusion was that 29 loci (approx. 1%) changed methylation status
with age: 23 cases of hypermethylation and six cases of hypomethylation. Most of these
methylation changes happened before middle age. Interestingly, the same CpG islands
affected in T cells also changed with age in other tissues, suggesting that methylation
instability is locus-speciﬁc.Interestingly,in T cells and various tissues from aging mice no
methylation changes were observed.
THE AGING GENOME
225

When interpreting these results it has to be realized that not all CpG islands were
investigated in this study (there are probably more than 20 000 CpG islands in the human
genome) and that there are many genes that lack CpG islands. Nevertheless, the results of
this study basically conﬁrm on a global scale the results of the many previous, isolated
studies in which certain genes were found to change methylation status with age, some-
times an increase and sometimes a decrease, but most were not. It should be noted that
stochastic changes in methylation pattern cannot be analyzed because the techniques to
select for genes or genome sequences that have undergone an isolated methylation
change in one or few cells are currently lacking.At any rate,if it is true that about 1% of all
genes suffer from changes in methylation status with age in a fraction of cells that is sufﬁ-
ciently large to be detectable, then the conclusion should be that the epigenome is much
less stable with age than the genome.
There is other evidence pointing in the same direction. In a recent study, global and
locus-speciﬁc epigenetic differences between identical twins were reported to arise with
age716. In this study, involving 80 twins varying in age from 3 to 74 years, a variety of
epigenomic markers, including X-chromosome inactivation, total genomic 5-methylcy-
tosine content, sequence-speciﬁc DNA methylation (by bisulﬁte genomic sequencing),
and global methylation status (by RLGS), were assessed in blood in comparison with
measures of gene expression (using microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR). The
results indicate that while these monozygotic twins are epigenetically indistinguishable
early in life,at older age they start to exhibit remarkable differences in overall content and
genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation, affecting their
gene-expression proﬁles.
Evidence for a relaxation of epigenetic control of gene expression during aging has been
reported by multiple authors, with the stability of X inactivation and genomic imprinting
the obvious targets of study. For studying the reactivation of inactive X-linked genes mice
are often used harboring an X-autosomal translocation, so that the normal (i.e. non-
translocated) X chromosome is always the one that is inactivated. Hence, when the activ-
ity of a gene can be assessed speciﬁcally on the normal X chromosome (because the other
one is defective) it is possible to verify whether during aging a supressed gene is re-activated.
For example, in the mouse an approx. 50-fold age-related increase in liver cells that had 
re-activated the gene ornithine transcarbamoylase on the inactive X chromosome has
been observed. This was ascribed to an age-related reduction in DNA methylation717.
Age-associated loss of epigenetic repression of X-linked genes has been analyzed
quantitatively for the gene Atp7a in various tissues of the same X–autosomal transloca-
tion mouse model718. The results indicated a mean organ-speciﬁc relaxation of gene
repression in the oldest group of mice of up to 2.2% (this is the fraction of transcripts
from the inactive X relative to its active sister chromosome). Using the same quantitative
methodology,the Igf2 gene,imprinted in one mouse strain but not in another,was shown
to increase relaxation of its epigenomic repression at old age by up to 6.7%.
226
THE AGING GENOME

In humans,the situation may be different.Indeed,in a study of the X-linked HPRT locus
in 41 women heterozygous for mutations at this locus (causing Lesch–Nyhan syndrome),
an increase with age in HPRT	 skin ﬁbroblast clones over the expected 50% (as a conse-
quence of random X inactivation) was not found719. Further studies showed that the silent
locus does not detectably re-activate spontaneously in culture, but only in response to
treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, a potent inhibitor of methylation.Whereas this can
be interpreted in terms of locus-speciﬁc determinants of the stability of epigenomic control
(as is also suggested by the aforementioned RLGS results), Robin Holliday proposed that
age-related reactivation of a silent X-linked gene may be many times higher in mouse cells
than in human cells as part of the much tighter genetic control systems in long-lived versus
short-lived animals720. Hence, this could be another example of increased genome mainte-
nance capacity of humans as compared to mice. On the other hand, it would be in conﬂict
with the aforementioned RLGS results indicating substantially more alterations in global
methylation status in humans compared with mice. Sufﬁce it to say that also in this case
more,extended data-sets are needed to draw deﬁnite conclusions.
Decreased epigenomic control during aging would be in keeping with the so-called
dysdifferentiation theory of aging proposed by Richard Cutler (Phoenix, AZ, USA)721.
According to this hypothesis the primary process of aging is the time-dependent drifting
away of cells from their proper state of differentiation.Some experimental support for the
hypothesis had already been obtained earlier in the laboratory of Cutler himself in the
form of increased hybridization of globin gene probes to RNA extracted from brain and
liver of old versus young mice722. This was well before the emergence of PCR, and even
before the age of Northern-blot analysis (this method, with the name playfully coined
after Southern-blot analysis, is still a standard technique for identifying speciﬁc sequences
of RNA, in which RNA molecules are separated by electrophoresis, transferred to nitro-
cellulose, and identiﬁed with a suitable probe).
Methylation patterns are intricately related to changes in histone-modiﬁcation pat-
terns. As we have seen, together these epigenomic control systems are two sides of the
same coin: chromatin remodeling. DNA methylation acts synergistically with histone
deacetylation to repress transcription. DNMT1, for example, can associate with HDAC2
and DNMT-associated protein 1, a co-repressor, to form a complex that is recruited to
replication foci through interaction with PCNA. In view of the relationship between
chromatin structure and gene expression, it is important to know the possible conforma-
tional changes that may occur in the DNA of the genome during the aging process. For
example, changes in the stability of nucleosomes, the fundamental unit of chromatin
structure, could lead to repression or derepression of gene expression.
An interesting example of a possible role of DNA higher-order structure in controlling
aging is the progressive destabilization of repeated DNA in yeast, which has been demon-
strated to be the cause of aging in this species149 (see also Chapter 2).The packaging of DNA
and histones into heterochromatin in yeast occurs at telomeres, mating-type loci, and
THE AGING GENOME
227

rDNA and is mediated by the Sir2/3/4 complex. As described, extrachromosomal RNA
copies are generated by HR between the repeats of the rDNA array, possibly as a result of
erroneous HR repair of DSBs (Chapter 4). The resulting ERCs are segregated to the
mother cell, accumulate, and ultimately cause senescence. An important function of het-
erochromatin therefore seems to be the suppression of recombination. This would sug-
gest an age-related loss of heterochromatin, which is in keeping with reported changes in
nucleosome spacing with age and an altered sensitivity to nucleases723.Such a heterochro-
matin-loss model of aging has indeed been proposed724,but suffers from a chronic lack of
data conﬁrming a general relaxation of transcription control with age and its possible
structural relationship with a loss of heterochromatin and increased genomic instability.
Interestingly, David Sinclair (Boston, MA, USA) and co-workers recently demonstrated
that in mice SIRT1 is bound to repetitive DNA and to promoters of a number of genes. In
the brain, such binding was found to decrease with the age of the mouse. In mouse ES
cells SIRT1 was released from repetitive DNA in response to genotoxic stress in the form
of treatment with hydrogen peroxide (D. Sinclair, personal communication).
What are the possible mechanisms that drive epigenomic changes with age, such as
hypo- or hypermethylation? First of all, metabolism and environmental factors, such as
diet, may play very important roles by inﬂuencing the supply of methyl groups and/or by
affecting the activities of DNMTs725. A diet deﬁcient in methyl donors can promote
hypomethylation. Dietary factors are likely to be critically important very early on, when
methylation patterns are established.As mentioned in Chapter 3,genome-wide demethyla-
tion occurs before embryo implantation,which is followed by de novo global remethylation
before organs develop.This allows the establishment of gene-speciﬁc methylation patterns,
which subsequently determine tissue-speciﬁc transcription.Imprinting—the repression of
either the maternal or paternal allele—is another example of DNA methylation early
during development. Insufﬁcient development of DNA-methylation patterns can lead to
embryonic lethality and developmental malformations.There is even evidence that dietary
factors in utero modulate disease risk in later life by affecting methylation patterns.
An example of a nutrient important for methylation is folate, a water-soluble vitamin
B. Folate acts in the methionine cycle and is critically important in the synthesis of
S-adenosylmethionine, the common methyl donor for DNA methylation. Folate deﬁ-
ciency leads to a decrease in S-adenosylmethionine and an increase in homocysteine.
Dietary deﬁciencies in folate can decrease genome-wide methylation, both in humans
and animals, and methylation is corrected by folate supplementation. The mechanisms
contributing to the age-dependent changes in global DNA methylation may include a
decrease in expression of DNMT1. Interestingly, micronutrient deﬁciency can mimic
radiation or chemicals in damaging DNA by causing SSBs,DSBs,and oxidative lesions726.
While undoubtedly important for optimizing methylation and histone-modiﬁcation
patterns during aging, nutritional and metabolic factors cannot be the only causes of a
general loss in transcription control through epimutation. As discussed in Chapter 4,
228
THE AGING GENOME

epigenomic status needs maintenance during and after DNA transactions. Errors during
this process may be inevitable, similar to the DNA-sequence mutations that occur after
the repair of chemical damage in DNA. However, it is also possible that epimutations are
consequences of DNA-sequence changes. Since the local structure of DNA is nucleotide-
sequence-dependent, mutations can be expected to inﬂuence the chromatin, thereby
causing gene-expressional changes. The same is true for DNA damage, which has been
demonstrated to cause changes in nucleosome positioning727. DNA methylation and
DNA–histone and DNA–non-histone protein interactions together are thought to organ-
ize the genome into transcriptionally active and inactive zones. DNA damage and muta-
tions can disturb this pattern of regulation, thereby causing normally silenced alleles to
be expressed and vice versa. It is therefore possible that age-related changes in DNA-
methylation patterns and histone protein changes are secondary rather than primary
events in the aging process.
6.4 Summary and conclusions: a DNA damage 
report of aging
Of the three categories of DNA alteration deﬁned at the beginning of this chapter it has by
now been fairly well established that all of them occur with age. Their relative contribu-
tion and possible causal relationship with aging is unknown, but in spite of the scarcity of
high-quality data on a broad range of human and animal tissues and the large variation in
technical approaches in studying a given genome alteration we can at least begin the issu-
ing of a genome damage report. I have summarized some of the data presented in this
chapter in the form of a list of genome alterations for those categories for which we have
reliable quantitative information at old and young ages (Table 6.2). This is limited to data
obtained with mutation reporter loci, such as HPRT and the lacZ and lacI transgenes.
Martijn Dollé in my laboratory extrapolated the mutation frequencies from the various
reporter genes to the entire 6  109-bp diploid genome. This gave us absolute values for
the average mutation load in a diploid cell. Needless to say, this is based on the assump-
tion that these reporter genes are representative for the genome overall. However, since
there are no major differences between results obtained with different reporters, apart
from those that can be expected on the basis of the type of gene and/or assay used 
(e.g. X-linked or autosomal, neutral or functional), this seems a reasonable assumption.
I have also limited this report to the nuclear genome, because we already know that
mtDNA mutations in several tissues accumulate to a level that is close to exerting adverse
effects. Table 6.2 is also restricted to mammals (humans and mice) in view of the virtual
lack of data for other organisms, with exception of yeast (see Chapter 7).
THE AGING GENOME
229

The estimate that can be derived from Table 6.2 suggests that the total mutational load
for most organs or cell types increases with age, some times quite substantially. The
increase,however,as well as the total mutation load,is highly cell-type- or tissue-dependent.
At old age, cells suffer from a total mutation load of at least several hundred alterations,
including a number of genome rearrangements. This is in reasonable agreement with
estimates of the human mutation rate in somatic cells, made by Alec Morley on the basis
of HPRT and HLA mutational reporter genes728. Expressed per unit of time rather than
per cell division,these results suggest a mutation rate of 73  104,or almost one in 1000,
over a 100-year lifespan. Extrapolated to the entire diploid genome this would amount to
about 400 mutations.
The question whether such mutation loads are high enough to cause the pathophysio-
logical changes associated with aging is the subject of the next chapter. However, we
should ﬁrst realize that the numbers provided in Table 6.2 are underestimates, for at least
two reasons. First of all, they only include mutations that affect the reporter gene to a suf-
ﬁciently large degree to inactivate its function almost entirely. We already discussed that
in the case of HPRT this is likely to lead to false-negative results. In general, one would
expect that there are many mutations with an adverse effect that is not strong enough to
be selected in a reporter-based assay, but does contribute to aging-related deﬁciencies. In
this respect, the results obtained with different reporter assays are not directly compara-
ble in view of the differences between genes in sensitivity to mutations. For example, the
lacI gene is about three times smaller than the lacZ gene and one would therefore expect
to ﬁnd lower mutation frequencies at this locus. Instead, as shown in Table 6.2, the muta-
tion frequencies for this reporter are only slightly lower. This is even more surprising

Columns for mutation frequency and load show young followed by old animals. Intra refers to lacZ internal mutations.
GR means genome rearrangements. For HPRT the target sizes shown are for the coding region and the total gene.

in view of the fact that with the lacI gene, which is based on bacteriophage 
 vectors, all
the larger mutations, such as genome rearrangements, go undetected (see above). The
explanation for the relatively high lacI mutation frequency is a larger number of sites that
when mutated give rise to phenotypic effects. We never systematically analyzed the satu-
ration of the lacZ gene in terms of the number of amino acids mutated, but this has been
done for the lacI gene and another reporter, the 
 cII gene. The cII gene is much smaller
than the lacI gene, but generally yields higher mutation frequencies, due to its increased
sensitivity to mutations729.
The second reason that the results in Table 6.2 are probably underestimates is of course
the demonstrated instability of large regions in the genome, sometimes two to three
orders of magnitude more unstable than what has been found with the aforementioned
reporter genes. For example, based on an estimated number of about 30 000 microsatel-
lite loci in our genome, the observed increase in mutant microsatellites at several loci
during aging of 1–4%681 corresponds to 300–1200 mutants per diploid genome. Many
other classes of genomic sequence remain uninvestigated in relation to aging,but it is very
likely that, for example, transposition events will eventually turn out to be major contrib-
utors to the level of genomic change with age. Most notably, I have not been able to
include any epigenomic changes since these cannot be estimated on a per-cell basis due to
the lack of suitable methods of detection.
In conclusion, the data thus far available on genome alterations indicate that in spite of
the large amounts of chemical damage to the genome induced continuously throughout
the lifespan, this type of alteration is unlikely to contribute much to the aging phenotype.
If so, and I should make it clear that the evidence for this is not yet fully conclusive, then
this lack of a major effect is almost entirely due to the extraordinary capacity of our
genome-maintenance systems to quickly repair virtually all such lesions. The importance
of these systems for the cell clearly warrants the enormous investments in them (Chapter
4).The outstanding performance of our genome-maintenance systems is also responsible
for the extremely low rate of errors that prevent the two other types of genome alteration,
genetic and epigenetic changes, from accumulating much faster. In most cases this guar-
antees that an organism can mature and reproduce, often multiple times. Eventually,
however, even extremely rare errors add up, especially in a genome that is robust; that is,
designed to tolerate many random alterations. As we have seen, tolerance is an efﬁcient
way to maintain the function of large genomes,which are impossible to fully protect from
random alteration by genome-maintenance systems alone. However, even slight
increases above the tolerable level of genome alterations should then give rise to a decline
in ﬁtness. Such a gradual loss of genome integrity is in keeping with the nature of aging,
which is a gradual process of ﬁtness decline and does not involve dramatic changes over
short periods of time. Based on the results thus far obtained it is likely that the loss of
genome integrity as a possible cause of aging is based on instability at multiple types of

loci acting in concert. As we have seen, even manipulation of the frequency of mtDNA
mutations,often considered as a cause of aging on its own,is insufﬁcient to bring forward
in time all the known senescent phenotypes. Together, however, the various types of
genome alteration observed could very well destabilize the genome to the extent that this
leads to the adverse phenotypic effects observed during aging. It is to the nature of these
phenotypic effects and their possible causal relationship with genome destabilization that
I now turn.

THE AGING GENOME

From genome to phenome
Greatly increased knowledge about the genome, including the complete DNA sequence
for a multitude of species, has brought us much closer to understanding how adult mam-
malian physiology and pathology are embedded in the structural characteristics of DNA,
chromatin, and cellular nuclei. The main challenge in our postgenomic era is to unravel
the genomic basis of variations in proteins, cells, and systems and identify the causative
networks that determine the development of form and functional differentiation in mul-
ticellular organisms. This work is far from complete and essentially differs from studying
how structural alteration in somatic genomes adversely affects organismal structure and
function as part of the aging process, which presents its own unique challenges.
In Chapter 1,I introduced the term phenome: the sum total of biochemical,physiolog-
ical, and morphological characteristics of an organism. The phenome relates to the phe-
notype as the genome relates to the genotype,as its manifest physical properties.Although
the semantics of the -omics world are sometimes confusing730,in my deﬁnition a phenome
is not restricted to phenotypic traits with genotypic origins, but includes environmental
and lifestyle inﬂuences.To identify the contribution of irreversible,random alterations in
genome structural information to the aging process, it is necessary to reconstruct the
sequence that may lead from somatic mutational events to the phenotypic features that
describe the aging phenome.In addition,since on the basis of both evolutionary and phe-
nomenological considerations aging is a multifactorial process affecting most if not all
bodily functions, genome deterioration may be a universal, conserved cause of senescent
deterioration, but does not necessarily underlie each and every aging-related phenotype.
Other primary causes of aging not residing in the somatic genome may exist and it is
important to distinguish those from genome-dictated causes.
In this chapter I will discuss a possible causal relationship between stochastic accumula-
tion of genome alterations as described in the previous chapter and the aging phenome.As
described previously,genome alterations are those changes that irreversibly alter the infor-
mation content of the genome.This includes chemical changes in DNA primary structure,
alterations in DNA sequence or DNA sequence organization, as well as epigenomic alter-
ations, such as changes in methylation patterns or histone modiﬁcation. For the purpose
of this discussion,it is necessary to deﬁne the aging process,not on the basis of the demon-
strated mortality increase in aging cohorts, but as a series of degenerative processes occur-
ring in individual organisms over their lifetime. Whereas the former, population-based
deﬁnition of aging has been very useful for understanding aging as a biological process,it is
less informative for an investigation into what happens in the individual.

Many if not all organs, tissues, and cell types show an age-related decline in function,
often accompanied by an increase in disease incidence. For example, muscle strength
declines with age, atherosclerotic plaques build up in the arteries, immune functions
decline, bones often weaken, and—the most visible aging phenotype—skin wrinkles and
loses underlying fat. These changes often interact, making it difﬁcult to distinguish
between primary and secondary age changes. For example, wasting of skeletal muscle
may not be caused primarily by changes in muscle cells, but by a decrease in circulating
IGF-1, produced by the liver primarily in response to growth-hormone stimulation. The
fact that growth hormone itself is produced by the pituitary gland further complicates the
situation.
Whereas cell autonomous age changes may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd, some have been
described, most notably in stem cells. For example, highly puriﬁed hematopoietic stem
cells were found to undergo signiﬁcant changes in their capacity to generate lymphoid
and myeloid progenitors, with reduced B lymphocyte production. This was reﬂected in
the up- or downregulation of genes involved in specifying these lineages, as assessed by
microarray analysis731. It was suggested that gene-expression changes in these stem cells
would ultimately be responsible for the well documented age-related loss of immune
function and increased incidence of various leukemias. Interestingly, transplantation of
old stem cells into young bone marrow and vice versa indicated that the adverse effects of
aging in these cells were not due to the microenvironment of the aging bone marrow.The
study did not make it clear what ultimately caused the autonomous effects of aging on
hematopoietic stem cells, other than that they could be due to age-dependent changes in
gene expression. Whatever the cause of the problem, there is no evidence for a loss of
hematopoietic stem cells with age. In fact, the number of such cells has been found to
increase with age, but they become less functional732.
Aging-related cell-autonomous loss of function is not a general characteristic of stem
cells, as indicated by work with muscle stem cells. Skeletal-muscle satellite cells are nor-
mally quiescent in adult muscle, but act as a reserve population of cells, able to proliferate
in response to injury and give rise to regenerated muscle and to more satellite cells. Tom
Rando (Stanford, CA, USA) and co-workers demonstrated that a decline in skeletal-
muscle stem-cell activity, resulting in impaired regeneration of aged muscle, could be
reversed through parabiotic pairings (connecting the shared circulatory systems) between
young and old mice, thereby exposing old mice to young serum733. This suggests that the
age-related decline of progenitor cell activity in muscle is not autonomous since it can be
modulated by systemic factors that change with age. Also in this case the age-related
impairment of muscle regeneration is not due to depletion of stem cells. Whereas the
number of such cells may decrease with age by 20–30%, more than enough of them
remain to mount a regenerative response.
A question that may come up at this point is whether a process that is as complex,multi-
factorial, and interactive as the aging process can be captured for a given individual in
234
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

some sort of global index. This has been attempted in the form of programs to establish
biomarkers. Biomarkers are usually associated with disease. For example, cardiac bio-
markers are enzymes, proteins, and hormones that are associated with heart function,
damage, or failure734. Some of the tests are speciﬁc for the heart whereas others are also
elevated with skeletal-muscle damage. Cardiac biomarkers are used for diagnostic and
prognostic purposes,along with other laboratory and non-laboratory tests,to detect heart
failure as well as to help determine prognosis for people who have had a heart attack.There
are also biomarkers for susceptibility to a disease,as well as biomarkers for drug responses.
Biomarkers for aging are supposed to be age-related changes that measure biological
rather than chronological age and predict the onset of age-related diseases more accu-
rately than by counting years.This is signiﬁcantly different from the disease-based concept
of biomarkers mentioned above, which is practically oriented. Indeed, whereas disease
biomarkers recognize both individual variation and the variation inherent in the com-
plexity of the disease process, biomarkers for aging are based on the assumption that, in
spite of the complexity of its phenotype, aging has an underlying common cause distinct
from disease that can be captured in some rate measure to predict individual mortality
and morbidity. It is certainly possible that aging reﬂects some basic mechanism common
to all somatic cells. Indeed, it is the premise of this book that such a basic mechanism
involves instability of the somatic genome. However, multicellular organisms contain
many specialized cell types, which alone or in combination create multiple physiological
systems. There is no evidence for markers that presage aging rate in every one of these
systems,and it is also highly unlikely that they all degenerate at the same pace.Indeed,dif-
ferent organ systems age at various rates within the body, which essentially constrains the
possibility of capturing biological age and mortality risk using a limited number of bio-
markers735. Nevertheless, biomarkers for aging-related disease phenotypes can be used in
combination to obtain measures of age or functional proﬁle relative to an individual’s
chronological peers. Studies of this kind have given us an intriguing glimpse of a possible
relationship between aging and disease.
An example is the approach taken by Ravi Duggirala (San Antonio, TX, USA), who
studied the heritability of biological aging in a Mennonite population736. Such relatively
isolated, homogenous populations lend themselves well to genetic investigations of com-
plex phenotypes such as aging.To measure biological aging,the phenotypic data available
for this population were used as the predictor variables of chronological (actual) age with
the predicted age relative to chronological peers estimated using regression analysis. The
residuals (i.e. the difference between chronological and predicted ages) were used as a
measure of biological age; individuals with negative residual values are considered bio-
logically older and individuals with positive residual values biologically younger compared
with their chronological ages.The phenotypic data involved as many as 41 predictorvariables,
including such blood chemistry variables as glucose, high-density lipoprotein/cholesterol
ratio, and total iron, and other variables such as blood pressure, body mass index, hand

steadiness, and grip strength. Hence, these predictors are really biomarkers for complex,
aging-related diseases, such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, renal func-
tion, and general functional deterioration in the elderly.
The total phenotypic variance of the residuals (i.e. biological age) was partitioned into
genetic and random environmental components. Heritability could be determined on
the basis of family relationships among the study population. As it appeared, these resid-
uals were signiﬁcantly heritable, but independent of the genetic and environmental
effects associated with the predictors.Hence,the factors that inﬂuence the genetic variance
in biological age may be unrelated to the genetic factors that underlie the age-dependent
phenotypic expression of the predictors, the quantitative markers of various physiologi-
cal or functional processes.Therefore,these results suggest that there is a general,intrinsic
process of aging with a genetic component of its own, predisposing to aging-related dis-
ease phenotypes, each of which can also have independent genetic and environmental
risk factors (Fig.7.1).This is not contradictory; it simply reﬂects the notion of a process of
intrinsic aging, possibly universal to all organisms, which can be modiﬁed by factors that
may be speciﬁc for the species or the individual. The recent dramatic improvements in
high-throughput methodology for identifying genes controlling complex phenotypes in
population-based studies provides the most likely way to test this hypothesis, as will be
outlined at the end of this chapter.
Attempts to capture biological age on the basis of hypothetical biomarkers, or more
realistically on the basis of functional status and disease, raise the question of what is

The aging phenome
Fig. 7.1 The hypothetical relationship between intrinsic aging and aging-related disease. It is
likely that during evolution, late-onset, disease gene variants accumulated in the germ line as
dictated by the evolutionary theory of aging for which there is now universal consensus. Intrinsic
aging, on the other hand, may involve universal mechanisms, such as genome instability, occur-
ring in individuals of all species. It is possible that intrinsic aging processes contribute to aging-
related disease.

and what is not part of the aging phenome. To some extent, I already addressed this
question in Chapter 5 by deﬁning an aging phenotype as an observable characteristic of
an organism that falls outside the realm of natural selection because it has no negative
impact on reproductive success. This deﬁnition would clearly include diseases, as long
as they arise after the reproductive period. Some have suggested that aging is not a dis-
ease and that it is necessary to carefully separate late-life disease phenotypes from the
intrinsic process of irreversible change predisposing to disease. Whereas it is obviously
possible and also necessary to distinguish between aged tissue that does and aged tissue
that does not contain pathological lesions such as tumors, I do not believe that age-
related disease can be separated from aging. While attempts to do this are discussed
below, it should be kept in mind that we often lack information about the natural cause
of death of individual organisms at extreme old age. For the best-studied (mostly
Western) populations of H. sapiens, by far the most meticulously researched species in
terms of aging-related pathology, arteriosclerosis (especially atherosclerosis and its
sequelae, such as coronary and cerebrovascular disease), diabetes, hypertension, senile
dementia, and senile amyloidosis are the particularly important pathologies and,
together with cancer, account for the bulk of mortality at old age. Infectious disease,
most notably pneumonia, is a common ﬁnal cause of death in old people. Other dis-
eases, such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, are also prevalent among the aged but
usually not lethal. However, especially among the oldest old, for those who manage to
escape the most common diseases of aging, the cause of death is often not known. In
such cases it is not possible to conclude that those who escaped disease will die of
intrinsic aging. Because of the complex interactions between aging phenotypes, natural
death may ultimately always be traced back to disease processes. For example, subtle
aberrations in cell structure, including tissue atrophies, neuropathies, and microvascu-
lar disease, may underlie the sudden deaths of old people when subjected to extreme
temperatures.
Our relative ignorance about the phenotypic associates of natural death at old age is
even more obvious for other species. Even in mice, the species with the second best-
characterized aging phenome, patterns of age-related pathology are incompletely
described and we often do not know the cause of death. Little is known about aging-
related pathology in invertebrate species (see further below).
Different causal factors can lead to very similar aging phenotypes. It is therefore possi-
ble that aging has one common denominator, for example, genome deterioration, and a
multitude of additional, private causes determined by both genotype and environment.
Some such factors may reinforce existing aging-related disease phenotypes. For example,
the genetic factors causing familial forms of Alzheimer’s disease accelerate the age of
onset and increase the severity of the disease. Indeed, neuroﬁbrillary tangles and senile
plaques, the neuropathological hallmarks of this disease, are merely less abundant and
widespread but not absent in the brains of intellectually intact elderly people737.
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
237

An aging phenome, therefore, is the sum total of multiple proliferative and degenera-
tive processes which can manifest as disease (e.g. atherogenesis, diabetes, cancer), rela-
tively benign non-disease symptoms (e.g.baldness),or symptoms generally recognized as
biomarkers of aging, such as collagen cross-linking, changes in T-cell subsets, and
cataracts. It is questionable whether any grouping of aging phenotypes into categories of
disease-related or non-disease-related phenotypes is biologically meaningful. They are
presumably all a result of diminishing selection pressure after the reproductive period
and the interactive nature of aging phenotypes would make it very difﬁcult to distinguish
between a non-disease-related,degenerative change and a disease-related one.Systematic
approaches to better deﬁne aging phenomes of multiple species through phenotypic
ontologies are imperative (see also Chapters 1 and 5). Such standardized vocabularies of
terms would provide the means to digitize species-speciﬁc phenomes, thereby making
them computationally accessible. Interactive databases of such digitized aging phenomes
in different species and genotypes, seamlessly integrated with molecular data-sets at the
various -omics levels,in combination with the dramatic advances in gene network theory
as outlined in Chapter 1, would open up the possibility of tracing back individual aging
phenotypes to alterations in the action of speciﬁc functional pathways. In this way we
may ultimately succeed in reducing aging in a particular species to a relatively limited
number of primary events (Fig. 7.2). The question that is central to this chapter and,
indeed, for the book as a whole, is whether such primary events include random genome
alteration and, if so, what the mechanisms are that lead from these stochastic changes to
consistent functional endpoints common to different individuals, populations, and even
species. Clues to this end can be obtained from the etiology of cancer, the only aging-
related phenotype that is generally recognized as likely to be directly due to increased
genome alterations, both genetic and epigenetic.

7.1 The causes of cancer
Cancer stands out as a major aging-related pathology in mammals and in the histopatho-
logical analysis of animals it is common to distinguish between neoplastic and non-neo-
plastic lesions. In mammals a large fraction of all pathological lesions at the end of life are
neoplastic lesions, with age as the single most important risk factor of the commonest
forms of cancer (Fig. 7.3)738. Because genome alterations are generally assumed to be the
main driver of carcinogenesis,it is relatively easy to make the case that mutation accumula-
tion is responsible for the age-related increase in cancer incidence and mortality. However,
as discussed below,other factors that are subject to changes with age may contribute as well.
In Chapter 5 cancer was considered as the opposite of aging, with the former a result of
increased, uncontrolled cell division and the latter frequently associated with cell loss or
loss of proliferative capacity. This antagonism was only fully realized when scrutinizing
the results of the action of the two main cellular systems that defend our tissues against
cancer: apoptosis and cellular senescence.While anti-cancer,these processes are generally
pro-aging and we have already seen how syndromes of accelerated aging could be a result
of a steep increase in such cellular responses to DNA damage (Chapter 5). Before turning
to genome instability and how it causes cancer, we will ﬁrst take a closer look at the sys-
tems that are supposed to defend us against cancer and the possibility that their actions
contribute to some aspects of the aging phenome.
7.1.1 SENESCENCE AND APOPTOSIS
While not without logic, the perceived antagonism between cancer and aging is somewhat
misleading. Indeed, it is entirely based on model systems in which cellular or organismal

aging is greatly exaggerated. For example, whereas cellular senescence in vitro (literally,
aging under glass) appears as a dramatic example of what may happen with cells during
the aging of an organism (Fig. 7.4), the situation of such cells is really incomparable with
the situation in their natural environment in vivo. As discovered by Leonard Hayﬂick
(San Francisco, CA, USA), human ﬁbroblasts derived from embryonic or adult tissues,
including skin, invariably undergo cessation of proliferation after a ﬁxed number of
population doublings in culture418.This has often been interpreted as mirroring the aging
process in vivo. To some extent this reﬂects August Weismann’s original idea that through
natural selection the division potential of somatic cells becomes ﬁnite, thus limiting the
regeneration of the soma and the lifespan of the organism739. It is now clear that replica-
tive senescence is a major tool in the extensive arsenal of mammalian cells to control
cancer; however, as such it likely contributes to some of the degenerative aspects of aging.
Replicative senescence in normal human ﬁbroblasts in culture is due to progressive
telomere shortening and can be prevented by ectopic expression of telomerase in these
cells650 (see also Chapters 4 and 6). Telomere-directed replicative senescence is a charac-
teristic of primates in general and also for ungulates (hoofed mammals), but not for
rodents740. In contrast to humans, rodents express telomerase in most of their adult
tissues741. Rodent ﬁbroblasts reach senescence very early after only a few population
doublings and generally acquire the capacity for unlimited proliferation.As we have seen,
240
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
Fig. 7.4 The dramatic morphological changes that normal ﬁbroblasts undergo as a consequence
of the senescence response are difﬁcult to miss. Left: early-passage rat skin ﬁbroblasts are spindle-
shaped and divide rapidly. Right: after several population doublings virtually all proliferating cells
have stopped dividing and are now greatly enlarged, with a number of structural characteristics
typical for such cells.

results obtained by Judith Campisi and co-workers have now made it clear that mouse
cells become senescent primarily because of the high oxygen tension under normal culture
conditions353. When mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts are cultured under conditions of low
oxygen, senescence was not observed. It is unclear whether this apparent immortality is
due to immortalization of cells which then gradually take over the population or to the
lack of telomere-directed senescence which would make these cells immortal from the
beginning. Nevertheless, since after repeated passaging at 3% oxygen mouse embryo
ﬁbroblasts no longer undergo senescence, even at 20% oxygen353, the cells must have at
least adapted to culture conditions.
When interpreting these results it should be kept in mind that virtually all studies with
rodents have been done with laboratory mice (and sometimes rats). Wild mice have
much shorter telomeres742 and to my knowledge telomerase expression levels have never
been measured in adult tissues of such animals.Therefore,the possibility cannot formally
be excluded that cells from these animals undergo senescence like human cells.
Nevertheless,it is conceivable that,as discussed extensively in Chapter 4,rodent cells miss
some important defense system(s) which human cells do have that protects them against
the effects of high oxygen. This does not mean that human cells do not suffer the adverse
effects of oxidative stress. Indeed, increasing oxygen tension also accelerates replicative
senescence in normal human ﬁbroblasts, to some extent by accelerating telomere attri-
tion743. Apart from their increased capacity to survive and replicate under adverse condi-
tions, human cells have acquired the telomere-counting mechanism that, in the absence
of the enzyme telomerase, so effectively induces senescence as a protection against cell
immortalization and transformation.
Replicative senescence is primarily a DNA-damage response and can be induced in
cultured cells (in the presence of intact telomeres) by various mutagenic agents, most
notably agents that cause genome-rearrangement mutations, such as ionizing radiation
or hydrogen peroxide. Senescence is generally distinguished from a phenomenon called
crisis. If senescence fails, for example, due to the inactivation of the p53 DNA-damage-
response pathway, cells will continue to divide until they reach a stage of mitotic
catastrophe, which is characterized by a high frequency of chromosomal aberrations,
apoptosis, and cellular senescence (see also Chapter 4).
It is not clear how relevant cellular senescence is for aging in vivo. While there is
evidence for an accumulation of senescent cells in the skin of aging humans501, a lack of
reliable markers has essentially constrained an accurate quantiﬁcation of their exact
numbers, which even at very old age may be only modest. Nevertheless, especially in
proliferative tissues a loss of functional cells may exert an adverse effect at old age. For
example,it has been demonstrated that areas of the endothelial lining of the blood vessels
exposed to high hemodynamic stress undergo more rapid telomere loss with age744. This
suggests some importance of focal replicative senescence in vivo in areas of high cell
turnover, with a possible role in cardiovascular disease (see also below).
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
241

Also using telomere dysfunction as a marker, John Sedivy (Providence, RI, USA) and
co-workers demonstrated an exponential increase of senescent cells in the skin of aged
baboons, up to about 15%745. Finally, important evidence that replicative senescence
could be important in vivo was provided by work from Rita Effros (Los Angeles, CA,
USA). Cytotoxic T cells, the immune cells responsible for control of viral infection (see
below), undergo replicative senescence in culture after repeated rounds of proliferation
similar to ﬁbroblasts.Effros and co-workers demonstrated that in both elderly people and
in people chronically infected with HIV there are high proportions of senescent cytotoxic
T cells746. This indicates that the replicative capacity of such cells is exhausted, which may
explain the compromised immune response in both elderly and AIDS patients.
Even when senescent cells would only comprise a very small fraction of the total, the
possibility cannot be ruled out that they will exert an adverse effect. For example, accu-
mulation of non-dividing senescent cells may compromise tissue renewal or repair. In
addition, senescent cells encode secreted proteins that can alter the tissue microenviron-
ment, stimulating the proliferation of cells that harbor pre-neoplastic mutations747.
Nevertheless, under normal conditions, the impact of cellular senescence in vivo is likely
to be small and it certainly never rises to the level observed in the cell-culture model.
The other major anti-cancer mechanism with potentially pro-aging side effects is
apoptosis (also called programmed cell death), which is as clean in its action as senes-
cence is messy748. Cells that undergo apoptosis disappear extremely rapidly. They are
often phagocytosed when they are still alive. Hence, they do not induce an inﬂammatory
response and there is therefore no side effect of their action other than loss of cells.
(Another form of cell death,necrosis,is associated with pathological states and does cause
inﬂammation by leaking the contents of the cells.) Apoptosis is different from senescence,
which as we have seen not only represents a loss of functional cells, but also leaves them
around to exert adverse effects. Apoptosis is an essential component of animal develop-
ment749. It is important for the establishment and maintenance of tissue architecture
based upon formation and then removal of speciﬁc structures. This enables greater ﬂexi-
bility, as primordial structures can be adapted to different functions at various stages of
life or in different sexes.
Of more relevance to aging is the role of apoptosis as a defensive strategy to remove
infected, mutated, or otherwise damaged cells. Indeed, it has been suggested that one
mechanism through which caloric restriction would extend lifespan was by promoting
the death of senescent cells750. Defects in apoptosis can certainly promote cancer and
other disorders. On the other hand, increased spontaneous apoptosis is likely to be one of
the mechanisms underlying premature aging in mice with defective DNA repair (Chapter 5).
However, slightly increased rates of apoptosis (which are extremely low under normal
conditions, even at very old age) have been found associated with long-lived, calorically
restricted mice751. This would be in agreement with the hypothesis mentioned above that
apoptosis beneﬁts health span.
242
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

Whereas there can be no doubt that both senescence and apoptosis occur in tissues
during normal aging,their low spontaneous rates make it unlikely that we age because we
run out of cells. In one of my own research projects, extensive macroscopical and micro-
scopical examination of various tissues of aging mice, including measurements of organ
weights, do not indicate dramatic changes in mass or cellularity (D. Beems, unpublished
work). Nevertheless, tissue atrophy is a component of normative aging, which may
involve not only cell loss but also ﬁbrosis, decreases in size, and functional degeneration.
The possibility cannot be excluded that cellular senescence and cell death in key tissues,
possibly of small subpopulations,are a major determinant of aging.Of note,the view that
cell loss per se may not be a major contributor to human or animal aging does not invalidate
the antagonism between cancer and aging,as this is observed in the DNA-repair-defective
mouse models discussed in Chapter 5. There is no reason to doubt the validity of the pre-
mature aging symptoms observed in these animals, which almost certainly result from
impairment of processes involved in cellular proliferation. However, under normal con-
ditions these same symptoms may be caused not so much by a loss of cells but by a loss of
functional cells, which may be due to genome instability. This would explain why aging is
associated with both an increase in the incidence of cancer and progressive degeneration
of organ and tissue function.
7.1.2 CANCER AS A RESULT OF GENOME ALTERATIONS
While numerous endogenous and environmental factors inﬂuence cancer risk, there is
abundant evidence that cancer is primarily a disease of genomic instability. A lifetime of
accumulating mutations is the most likely, albeit not the only, explanation for why cancer
strikes older people so much more frequently than young people. In typical full-blown
cancer, cells are rife with genetic abnormalities. This conclusion goes back to at least
Theodor Boveri (1862–1915), who over 100 years ago proposed that cancer is based on
aberrant chromosome combinations (now known as aneuploidy)752. As we have seen in
Chapter 1, this was the time when the general theory of chromosomal inheritance came
to fruition. Boveri’s proposal that malignant tumors could be the result of an abnormal
chromosome constitution has now generally been accepted, albeit with a much broader
repertoire of genomic alterations than aneuploidy alone.
Early on, it was realized that cells achieve tumorigenic potential through speciﬁc phe-
notypic changes, allowing them to escape growth control and progress into a metastatic
tumor. Initially, the amount of genome instability observed, as well as its variation from
tumor to tumor, was difﬁcult to reconcile with the relatively small number of speciﬁc
changes that were thought to distinguish a normal from a tumor cell. Later, patterns were
discerned, most notably the now generally adopted scheme ﬁrst proposed by Bert
Vogelstein (Baltimore, MD, USA) and co-workers, which consists of different phases
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
243

from benign growth through a pre-cancerous stage and ultimately to metastasis753. More
and more genes were subsequently discovered that if altered were responsible for helping
the cell through these different phases. The wide variation from tumor to tumor in the
type of genetic variation was soon ascribed to the multiple ways a particular pathway can
be affected. As described in Chapter 1, genes almost never act alone, but in pathways and
ultimately networks. Hence, a particular attribute, such as the capacity to invade a tissue
or provide for blood vascularization, can be obtained through different genetic alter-
ations affecting the same pathway.
Because cancer is clonal, with a chance process being responsible for transforming a
single cell, a simple model of tumorigenesis through genomic alterations is as follows.
Cells accumulate random alterations in their genome as a consequence of imperfections
in genome maintenance and the continuous onslaught of DNA damage, as discussed in
Chapters 4 and 6. Most alterations would not contribute at all in setting the cell on its
pathway to cancer. They would have either no effect at all, adversely affect one or several
cellular functions, or may occasionally be lethal. By chance, random mutations would
release some of the bonds that restrain the cell from uncontrolled growth. This would
result in clonal outgrowth.A second set of genomic alterations,again occurring by chance
in one or more of the cells in the clonal outgrowth, would provide an additional growth
advantage for that cell and its progeny. This scenario would be repeated to guide tumor
development from clonal lineage to clonal lineage, eventually resulting in a full-blown
malignant tumor.
What this model does not address is the rate at which mutations accumulate or the
number and type of mutations necessary to provide for all the necessary attributes.While
in cell-culture models manipulation of only a few genes is sufﬁcient for tumorigenic con-
version of normal epithelial and ﬁbroblast cells754, many more speciﬁc changes are neces-
sary to provide a cell with all the characteristics it needs to survive the many cellular
safeguards that prevent uncontrolled cellular growth.Therefore,cancer needs many more
mutations than the normal background mutation frequency can provide. This was ﬁrst
realized by Larry Loeb, who subsequently proposed his mutator phenotype hypothe-
sis755,756.According to this hypothesis,mutations that increase mutation rates are essential
for tumors to evolve. Target genes for such mutations are genes that control the ﬁdelity of
DNA replication, the efﬁcacy of DNA repair, chromosome segregation, damage surveil-
lance (e.g. checkpoint control), and cellular responses (e.g. apoptosis). Mutations in
genes involved in genome maintenance can greatly increase the rate of genome instability,
including point mutations,microsatellite instability,and LOH.Whereas this increases the
chance of creating new mechanisms to escape normal cellular restraints, it would also
greatly increase mortality. Hence, once a cell has acquired its necessary attributes,
mutants will be selected in which survival is maximized by genome restabilization.
Cancer is a problem that is typically associated with renewable tissues.In nematodes or
fruit ﬂies virtually all cells of the body are postmitotic and cancer is not a part of the
244
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

pattern of aging-related pathology in these animals. It is possible that the evolution of
renewable somatic tissues provided an organism with increased longevity, since worn-out
cells can be replaced.However,such tissues are also highly vulnerable to unwanted prolif-
eration, which may lead to cancer according to the scenario described above421,757. It is
now generally assumed that only certain cells from a tumor—cancer stem cells—have the
capacity to initiate new, full-ﬂedged tumors. Since tumor-forming stem cells have not
been identiﬁed for all tumors it is difﬁcult to say whether this is true for cancer in general.
It is equally difﬁcult to judge whether cancer stem cells arise directly from mutations in
the normal stem cells that sustain various tissues,or only when these cells start dividing to
replenish a tissue.
It is often argued that cell proliferation is critically important to generate the mutations
that initiate the process of carcinogenesis. As we have seen in Chapter 4, errors during
DNA replication are a major source of the somatic mutations that drive malignant tumori-
genesis. However, mutations can occur equally well in non-dividing cells, although not all
types of mutations. Figure 7.5 shows the results of an experiment in my laboratory by a
student, Rita Busuttil, who treated embryonic ﬁbroblasts from the lacZ plasmid reporter
mice described in the previous chapter with two different DNA-damaging agents, ultravi-
olet light or hydrogen peroxide. To test for the inﬂuence of cell proliferation on the efﬁ-
ciency of mutation induction in these cells, she allowed one population to divide in an
unlimited manner, providing the cells with medium containing serum. The other popula-
tion was starved of serum by giving them only 0.5% serum rather than the usual 10%.This
results in so-called quiescent cells. (In the complete absence of serum the cells would die.)
The results show that while UV-induced mutagenesis is highly dependent on cell prolifer-
ation, hydrogen peroxide treatment resulted in slightly more mutations in the quiescent

cells than in the actively proliferating ones. Interestingly, while the replication-dependent,
UV-induced mutations were mainly point mutations, hydrogen peroxide treatment
resulted almost exclusively in the genome-rearrangement mutations discussed in the
previous chapter. Hence, these results suggest that point mutations are highly dependent
on replication errors, while genome rearrangements might be a result of mistakes during
annealing of double-strand breaks known to be induced by hydrogen peroxide. This latter
type of event apparently does not require DNA replication for its ﬁxation.
There is also evidence from other research groups that mutation accumulation in cells
during aging is less dependent on proliferation rate—the number of generations—than
on chronological time728. This means that tumor induction does not necessarily require
cell division and that non-dividing cells can accumulate a substantial number of muta-
tions during aging.Nevertheless,it is obvious that cells already destined to divide regularly,
such as epithelial cells, are more likely to develop into tumors than postmitotic cells, such
as neurons and cardiomyocytes.This is,of course,exactly what is generally observed.
Based on the above, it is logical to assume that a gradual accumulation of mutations
with age drives the increased incidence of cancer. However, other factors are likely to play
a role as well437.For example,it is highly conceivable that the aging process is accompanied
by gradual alterations creating an intra- and extracellular environment that is increasingly
permissive of the formation and progression of cancer758. This could involve gradual
declines in immune response, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Interestingly, another possibil-
ity, proposed by Judith Campisi and brieﬂy mentioned above, brings us back to replica-
tive senescence.Campisi was the ﬁrst to report the accumulation of senescent cells during
human aging, mainly in the skin. The changes in these cells include the secretion of bio-
logically active molecules, such as matrix metalloproteinases, inﬂammatory cytokines,
and growth factors, which can promote the proliferation and neoplastic transformation
of preneoplastic epithelial cells in stromal/epithelial co-cultures and in mice747. Hence,
cellular senescence in vivo can actually promote cancer, a somewhat surprising conclu-
sion with regard to a mechanism that is essentially anti-cancer. The logic behind this
potential pro-cancer effect of senescence in vivo is that the number of senescent cells only
begins to have such an effect long after the period of ﬁrst reproduction. In this concept,
the adverse effect of cellular senescence is a pleiotropic effect of its beneﬁcial effect of
keeping cancer at bay for a long enough time to reproduce421.
Whatever the importance of other host factors in explaining the increased cancer inci-
dence with age,there is no dispute about the role of genome alterations in tumor initiation
and progression. Genome alterations may play a role in cellular outgrowths in general,
including hyperplastic nodules and atherosclerotic plaques (see below). However, other
aging-related phenotypes, not based on clonal expansion, are generally not ascribed to
mutations. In the past, random mutations were thought to be so rare that they were con-
sidered unlikely candidates to cause phenotypes such as aging-related organ dysfunction.
This situation has changed to some extent with the realization that genomes are highly
246
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

dynamic, even in somatic cells. Indeed, as outlined in the previous chapter, a wide variety
of genome alterations have been demonstrated to occur in mammalian organs and tissues,
with the resulting mutations in some cases shown to accumulate with age. Indeed, as we
have seen, even in the absence of cell proliferation, aging will continue to promote geno-
typic divergence of tissues and organs by making errors during the processing of sponta-
neous DNA damage. Below, I will brieﬂy review aging phenotypes other than cancer and
discuss the possibility that they are also caused by random genome alterations.
7.2 Genome instability and tissue dysfunction
It is now generally accepted that genomes, including somatic genomes, are more plastic
than initially thought, essentially turning tissues of adult organisms into genotypic
mosaics by randomly altering the genome of their cells. However, there are no accurate
estimates of average genomic mutation loads of different cell types during aging,not even
for the small mitochondrial genome (see Chapter 6). Even if available, such data alone
would not be sufﬁcient to establish causal relationships. Before discussing how to test for
such causality, I will ﬁrst review some common aging-related, non-cancer phenotypes,
mainly in humans, to see if they possibly could be due to cellular degeneration as a
consequence of random genome alterations. I will also discuss possible alternative causal
factors, such as protein alterations.
7.2.1 HUMAN AGE-RELATED DEGENERATION
As has been stressed many times, aging has an extremely complex phenotype of which
cancer is a major part and in a category of its own due to its clonal nature and the known
general mechanism of its initiation and progression.Aging phenotypes other than cancer
are varied and usually become noticeable between the ages of 40 and 50.
7.2.1.1 Hearing
As people age, they may hear less well, and balance may become slightly harder to main-
tain. These changes occur because some structures in the cochlea (the part of the inner
ear that converts vibrations into nerve impulses sent to the brain) or auditory nerve 
(connecting the inner ear to the brain) deteriorate slightly. Presbycusis, as this is called,
appears to be based on the age-related degeneration of the stria vascularis, which main-
tains the ionic gradients necessary for sound signal transduction and the complex inter-
action between the inner and outer hair cells, possibly in combination with hair-cell
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
247

loss or ganglion cell loss759. Both the stria vascularis and the hair cells, which are all
postmitotic,are highly metabolically active and would be compromised by a deﬁciency of
intracellular ATP due to mitochondrial dysfunction760, which might ultimately lead to
cell degeneration and death. Interestingly, in mice lacking the antioxidant enzyme SOD1
(also known as CuZn-SOD), age-related cochlear hair cell loss was enhanced761. Hence,
in this case alterations in the mitochondrial and/or nuclear genome could evidently
underlie the degenerative effects.
7.2.1.2 Vision
There are a number of pathological causes of vision loss among the elderly and the most
common are age-related macular degeneration,glaucoma,cataract,and diabetic retinopa-
thy. An important pathological change in the lens (and often used as a biomarker for
aging) is cataract, likely to be caused by damage, cross-linking, and precipitation of crys-
tallins, contributing to a loss of lens clarity. Age-related cataracts are the most common
cause of blindness worldwide.
Around the age 40, most people notice that seeing objects closer than 1 m becomes
difﬁcult. This change in vision, called presbyopia762, occurs because the lens in the eye
stiffens. Normally, the lens changes its shape to help the eye focus.When the lens stiffens,
the eye cannot easily focus on objects that are close. The lens is enclosed by a thick capsu-
lar basement membrane under which lies a layer of cuboidal epithelial cells. These cells
differentiate into new lens ﬁbers, progressively overlaying the existing lens ﬁbers. While
the younger,outer lens ﬁbers are metabolically active,the older ﬁbers degrade their nuclei
and organelles,enabling the lens to maintain clarity.The lens ﬁbers are packed with trans-
parent proteins called crystallins. This structure is unique in that there appears to be no
protein turnover in the center throughout one’s lifespan763. Presbyopia, therefore could
be due entirely to age-related, post-translational protein modiﬁcations, such as aspartic
acid racemization (loss of optical purity), oxidation, glycation, and deamidation. Since
this would involve no cells, it essentially rules out random genome alteration as a causal
factor. However, changes in the ciliary body, a ring of smooth-muscle ﬁbers arranged
concentrically around the opening in which the lens is suspended, have also been impli-
cated in the phenotype and such changes could, in theory, be due to genome alterations.
7.2.1.3 Taste and smell
Generally, when people are in their 50s, the abilities to taste and smell start to gradually
diminish. Originally, taste decrements in the elderly were ascribed to a loss in the number
of papillae and taste buds. However, as evident from later studies, there may not be such
age-related losses and little is known about degenerative changes in gustatory neural
pathways764. Age-related decrements in odor perception could be due to a variety of
248
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

structural and physiological changes throughout the olfactory system, from olfactory
epithelium to the olfactory bulb and the olfactory cortex. There is no evidence for or
against a causal relationship with genome instability.
7.2.1.4 Skin
As people age, the skin tends to become thinner, less elastic, drier, and ﬁnely wrinkled765.
The layer of fat under the skin thins and is replaced by more ﬁbrous tissue.The number of
nerve endings in the skin decreases, as do the number of sweat glands and blood vessels.
Blood ﬂow in the deep layers of the skin decreases. While all aging phenotypes strongly
depend on environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors, skin aging is of course heavily
dominated by the degree of sun exposure and skin pigment. Chronological skin aging,
which depends on the passage of time and not on UV irradiation, is often distinguished
from photoaging, with which it shares some important molecular features. From this
point of view, photoaging is basically the superposition of UV irradiation from the
sun on intrinsic aging. While photoaging could work directly through the induction of
damage to DNA and other macromolecular structures, UV irradiation also activates 
cell-surface receptors, triggering downstream signal-transduction pathways, which leads
to photochemical generation of ROS. While the mechanism through which this happens
is unclear, it is conceivable that chronological skin aging also works through ROS, perhaps
in a similar way to other tissues.
It is tempting to speculate that accumulation of genome alterations in skin cells,result-
ing from DNA damage induced by UV irradiation or ROS, causes the loss of fat cells and
the reduced activity of sebaceous and sweat glands that are such an important compo-
nent of skin aging. However, protein cross-linking, for example due to glycation and the
formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs; see Chapter 6) is often implicated
as a major cause of the loss of ﬂexibility of collagen ﬁbers just below the dermis and the
stiffening of elastin, the protein that gives skin its ﬂexibility. Protein changes should
therefore be considered as a potential primary cause of skin aging.
Naturally, mutation accumulation has been implicated in the striking aging-related
vulnerability to skin cancer in humans,with suggestions of a possible role of an age-related
decline in DNA repair766. Also, telomere erosion has been implicated in skin aging, espe-
cially with regard to its degenerative,non-cancer features767,768.Of note,in the keratinocytes
of the continuously renewed epidermis telomerase is expressed and therefore able to
counteract telomere erosion.
7.2.1.5 Musculoskeletal system
Apart from thinner,wrinkled,leathery skin,the most visible evidence of aging is the strik-
ingly altered musculoskeletal system769,770: the bones,joints,and skeletal muscles (striated
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
249

muscles).In the course of the aging process,bones tend to become less dense and therefore
weaker and more likely to break. Bones become less dense partly because the amount of
calcium they contain decreases. Part of the reason for this is that less calcium is absorbed
in the digestive tract and levels of vitamin D (which helps the body use calcium) decrease
slightly. Osteoporosis is a major health problem, especially for women after the
menopause. Older people often appear to have lost height due to kyphosis, which has
already been described as a frequent aging phenotype appearing prematurely in mice
with defects in genome maintenance (Chapter 5). Also, the amount of bone marrow
decreases, with fewer blood cells produced.
Bone mass is maintained through a delicate balance between bone formation by
osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts771.This process of bone remodeling is pos-
sibly a consequence of the continuous stress exerted on bone and may lead to the replace-
ment of about 10% of all bone each year in humans.Hence,dissolving older bone mass by
osteoclasts and new bone formation by osteoblasts is the mechanism for the repair and
continuing strength of bone. It is the excess activity of osteoclasts (common after
menopause in women) that produces osteoporosis. Bone homeostasis depends upon the
intimate coupling of bone formation and bone resorption, which is subject to a complex
circuit of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones772.
The major inﬂuence on age-associated bone deterioration is generally considered to be
a deﬁciency of progesterone.However,the disease can also be caused by mineral and vita-
min deﬁciencies, drugs, poor eating habits, lack of exercise, too much cortisol, and too
little testosterone. This multitude of possible causes does not rule out the possibility that
ultimately, when all other factors are optimal, osteoporosis may still occur, but then as a
consequence of genome instability in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Indeed, it is possible
that genome instability in the stem-cell pools that give rise to these cells impairs new bone
formation and we have already seen that the increased DNA-damage responses in some
mice with accelerated aging adversely affect the bone cells, leading to kyphosis and osteo-
porosis in these animals (Chapter 5).
Specialized populations of bone cells form, maintain, and remodel the cartilage that
lines the joints. The cartilage tends to become thinner with age and, consequently, the
surfaces of a joint may not slide over each other as well as they used to. This makes the
joint more susceptible to injury with repeated injury often leading to osteoarthritis,
which is a common disorder in later life. Ligaments, which bind joints together, tend to
become less elastic as people age,making joints feel tight or stiff.Like the aforementioned
changes in collagen ﬁbers and elastin in the skin,and the changes observed in the eye lens,
these changes in ligaments are often ascribed to cross-linking of collagen molecules as a
result of oxidation or glycation.Currently there is no evidence that the activity of the cells
responsible for laying down and maintaining the ligaments undergo functional decline as
a consequence of genome instability.
250
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

As people age, the amount of muscle tissue (muscle mass) and muscle strength tend to
decrease. This process is called sarcopenia. Loss of muscle mass begins around age 30 and
continues throughout life.Muscle mass decreases because the number and size of of mus-
cle ﬁbers decreases. This change may occur because the levels of growth hormone and
testosterone, which stimulate muscle development, decrease with aging. Also, muscles
cannot contract as quickly in old age.
From the previous chapter we also know that mutation accumulation, especially in the
mitochondrial genome, in muscle ﬁbers is often considered as a most likely explanation
for age-related muscle wasting. However, systemic factors (which, in turn, can also have a
basis in genome alterations) play a major role in modulating adverse effects of age on
muscle regeneration. We have already seen that the failure of muscle satellite cells at old
age to regenerate lost muscle could be corrected by young serum733. Likewise, the age-
related decline in circulating IGF-1, which is well documented773, could underlie loss of
muscle mass and strength. Interestingly, this latter systemic defect could be reversed
locally through overexpression of IGF-1 in muscle cells774.
It is difﬁcult to investigate whether genome instability could ultimately be the primary
cause of systemic deﬁcits.Indeed,IGF-1 decline may be due to a reduction in GH,secreted
by the pituitary gland into the bloodstream, thereby reducing the production of IGF-1 by
the liver.GH and IGF-1 levels (as well as other related hormones,such as somatostatin) in
the body are tightly regulated by each other and by sleep, exercise, stress, food intake, and
blood-sugar levels. To make it even more complex, it is the hypothalamus that produces
hormones that regulate the pituitary gland. This serves to illustrate the difﬁculties in
deciding where the ultimate cause of muscle dysfunction may reside.
Muscles,of course,have to function almost everywhere.We have already seen that mus-
cle weakening may contribute to the aging of the lens, and elsewhere, for example the
muscles used in breathing, such as the diaphragm, tend to weaken as people age. Apart
from the skeletal, striated muscle there is smooth (or visceral) muscle, forming the muscle
layers in the walls of the digestive tract,bladder,various ducts,arteries,and veins,and cardiac
muscle,a cross between the smooth and striated muscles,comprising the heart tissue.
7.2.1.6 Brain
In contrast to what was originally thought, as people age, the number of nerve cells in the
brain decreases only slightly; this loss is focal, not global775. Several factors help compen-
sate for this decline. As cells are lost, new connections are made between the remaining
nerve cells. New nerve cells may form in some areas of the brain, even during old age. In
addition,the brain is redundant in the sense that it has more cells than it needs to perform
most activities. Some mental functions may be subtly reduced. They include vocabulary,
short-term memory,the ability to learn new material,and the ability to recall words.After
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
251

about age 60, the number of cells in the spinal cord begins to decrease. As a result, older
people may notice a decrease in sensation. At old age, nerves may conduct signals more
slowly. Also, the nervous system’s response to injury is reduced. Nerves may repair them-
selves more slowly and incompletely in older people than in younger people.
In humans the most dramatic changes in the brain are associated with disease, most
notably Parkinson’s disease776 and Alzheimer’s disease777. Parkinson’s disease is a move-
ment disorder with a resting tremor and problems in initiating or stopping movement.
Although there are many other neuronal groups affected in different brain regions in
Parkinson’s disease, the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the most
consistent feature of the disease. In addition, the disease is characterized by the presence
of so-called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in surviving nigral neurons, intracellular
aggregates of lipids and proteins,including ubiquitin and -synuclein.As mentioned ear-
lier in this chapter, it is not always easy to distinguish pathology associated with normal
aging from the situation in a patient. This is especially true for Alzheimer’s disease. The
hallmark phenotypes of this disease are the so-called amyloid neuritic (or senile) plaques,
found outside the cell and consisting of amyloid protein knotted up with tendrils of mal-
formed brain cells, and the neuroﬁbrillary tangles, made of a protein called tau clustered
inside neurons.Although generally much less widespread,both these lesions also occur in
the brain of normally aged individuals737.
Parkinson’s disease is usually ascribed to loss of function or dysfunction of certain
candidate genes, including -synuclein and parkin, leading to a decrease in dopamine lev-
els776. Likewise, faulty processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that increases
levels of the toxic amyloid 
 peptide is usually considered to underlie the pathogenesis of
Alzheimer’s disease778. However, there are several possible alternative causal factors to
explain the age-related nature of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s diseases.These explanations are not mutually exclusive and also do not rule out
the more proximal candidate causes underlying these diseases. Oxidative stress has been
implicated in both diseases and in neurodegeneration and aging in general779. Oxidative
stress could,for example,underlie protein aggregation,a hallmark of both diseases.Protein
aggregates are complexes of misfolded or unfolded proteins that are essentially insoluble
and metabolically stable under normal physiological conditions780. Their frequency of
occurrence in tissues and organs (not only in brain) is increased with age,with the two best
known forms being amyloid and lipofuscin. Neither the mechanisms of their formation,
nor their possible role as a causal factor in aging and aging-related disease, even for
Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease, are known with certainty. Protein damage is a
likely causal factor, but stochastic alterations in the stoichiometry of different proteins and
their polypeptide chains may play a role as well. The latter could be caused by increased
genome instability,which is likely to lead to aberrant patterns of transcription (see below).
DNA damage and genome instability have long since been implicated in Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s diseases. Evidence has been obtained, including data from my own
252
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

laboratory,that defects in DNA repair underlie familial forms of both Alzheimer’s disease
and Parkinson’s disease781,782 and increased DNA damage in the form of DNA breaks and
alkali-labile sites was found in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer’s disease596. More
recently, high levels of mtDNA deletions were found in the substantia nigra neurons in
both aged controls and individuals with Parkinson’s disease668,783. Based on the surpris-
ingly high frequency of chromosomal aneuploidy in the brains of both humans and mice
and the dramatic increase in LOH events in neuronal stem cells of mice during aging
(Chapter 6), it is conceivable that increased instability of the nuclear genome will also
eventually be found in selective cell populations of the elderly or patients with neurode-
generative disease. However, such analyses are more difﬁcult to carry out than searching
for mtDNA deletions, and data are still lacking.
7.2.1.7 Heart and blood vessels
There are a number of different types of change in the heart and blood vessels that occur
with age.There is some cell loss and an increase in size of cardiac myocytes.Some cells are
replaced with ﬁbrous tissue. The walls of the heart become stiffer, and the heart ﬁlls with
blood more slowly. There are deposits of lipofuscin and amyloid, but amyloid deposition
occurs only in half of people over 70 years.Overall,the cardiac physiology of physically ﬁt
elderly people is very similar to that of younger individuals, but they often require a
compensatory mechanism called the Starling mechanism784.
We are of course all familiar with the effects of aging on the blood vessels. The walls of
the large arteries thicken and become stiffer,due to alterations in elastin and calcium dep-
osition. This process of arteriosclerosis785 increases blood pressure and could be a reason
for the observed thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy). It can involve the arteries
of the cardiovascular system, the brain, the kidneys, and the upper and lower extremities.
Possible mechanisms underlying arteriosclerosis include the now familiar cross-linking
of collagen and other protein changes. For example, AGEs have been implicated in
increased vascular and myocardial stiffness, as well as in atherosclerosis. This is suggested
by the observation that patients with diabetes, who suffer from an accelerated rate of
advanced glycation of proteins, manifest arterial stiffening at a younger age.
Arteriosclerosis differs from atherosclerosis, which involves the build-up of fatty
deposits in the innermost lining of large and medium-sized arteries. Such lesions, termed
plaques, often lead to coronary heart disease, strokes, and other disorders because of the
occurrence of blood clots which form in the narrowed arteries or from ruptured plaques.
However,they also affect the medium-sized and large arteries of the brain,heart,kidneys,
and legs.Atherosclerosis develops over a period of decades and has a complex pathogenesis.
It probably begins with damage to the arterial wall, possibly due to transport of oxidized
low-density lipoprotein across the endothelium. This results in inﬂammation and the
formation of regions of foamy lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells,termed
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
253

fatty streaks, just beneath the intimal surface of large arteries. Continuous migration of
smooth muscle cells into the intima converts fatty streaks into the ﬁbrous plaques that
protrude into the arterial lumen. Later, calciﬁcation can occur and ﬁbrosis continues
yielding a ﬁbrous cap that surrounds a lipid-rich core. This formation may also contain
dead or dying smooth muscle cells.In myocardial infarction such ﬁbrous plaques rupture
and the subsequent formation and release of thrombi may ultimately occlude vessels.
Ultimately,therefore,atherosclerosis is defective wound repair and the result of a failure
in endogenous inhibitory systems that normally limit such repair. One such inhibitory
pathway is the transforming growth factor-
 signaling pathway, which inhibits clonal
expansion of the vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaques. A somatic
mutation within a microsatellite repeat tract in the coding regions of the transforming
growth factor-
 receptor gene in human atherosclerotic lesions has been reported and
proposed to account for the frequent clonal expansion of the vascular smooth-muscle
cells786. However, subsequent studies did not ﬁnd such mutations or only at low fre-
quency787.Nevertheless,the accumulation of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA muta-
tions, including genomic rearrangements, in vascular endothelium and smooth-muscle
cells may be important for the development of atherosclerosis788.
The involvement of mutations was originally inferred from the apparent monoclonality
of the smooth-muscle cells, the focal proliferation of which is characteristic of plaques and
likely to be an early step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis789. There are a number of
reports describing chromosomal alterations in human atherosclerotic plaques as compared
with adjacent normal tissue. Most of these studies were based on the use of microsatellite
markers to study LOH (similar to the LOH found to increase with age in mouse neuronal
stem or progenitor cells mentioned in the previous chapter). For example, in a recent study
DNA samples from 78 aortic plaques were compared with corresponding DNA from blood
taken from the same individuals790. Using 63 microsatellite markers, LOH was found in 37
out of the 78 atherosclerotic plaques. Interestingly, 33 histopathologically normal aortic
tissue samples were also compared with their corresponding blood samples and LOH was
detected in 6 out of 33 specimens. While this indicates a signiﬁcant association of allelic
imbalance with aortic atherosclerosis,it also illustrates how widespread genomic instability
is,even in seemingly normal tissue.As in most other complex,aging-related disease pheno-
types, many different cell types interact to give rise to atherosclerosis. Because not all these
cell types have been analyzed for changes in DNA or chromatin it is as yet too early to
conclude that genome instability is likely to play a role in the etiology of this disease.
Finally, relatively little is known about microvascular changes with age. However, there
is increasing evidence for its importance and microvascular alterations with aging can
greatly contribute to the development of stroke, skin and kidney aging, and vascular
dementia. Changes in vascular endothelial cells may contribute to microvascular degen-
eration and the possible role of telomere-directed cellular senescence in aging-related
degeneration of such cells has already been mentioned.

7.2.1.8 Alimentary system
Changes in the digestive system during aging are relatively minor.The muscles of the esoph-
agus contract less forcefully, but movement of food through the esophagus is not affected.
Food is emptied from the stomach more slowly,and the stomach cannot hold as much food
because it is less elastic. But in most people, these changes are too slight to be noticed. The
digestive tract may produce less lactase, an enzyme the body needs to digest milk. In the
large intestine, materials move through a little more slowly. In some people, this slowing
may contribute to constipation. A signiﬁcant fraction of elderly suffers from atrophic
gastritis,a process of chronic inﬂammation of the stomach mucosa (probably autoimmune
in origin) leading to loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual replacement by intes-
tinal and ﬁbrous tissues. As a result, the stomach’s secretion of essential substances such as
hydrochloric acid and pepsin is impaired, leading to digestive problems, vitamin B12 deﬁ-
ciency, and pernicious anemia. The age-related increase in both mtDNA and nuclear DNA
mutations in the intestine has been discussed extensively in the previous chapter.
The organ that has probably been studied most extensively in relation to aging is the
liver. Multiple age-related changes in structure and function have been described for this
organ in both humans and rodents, but many of the observations are contradictory791.
There is some reduction in liver mass and total blood ﬂow. There is some evidence that
the liver tends to become smaller because the number of cells decreases. However,
declines in cell number have been reported for all organs at some point in the past, with
later contradictory reports after some more careful studies, brain being the best example.
Liver is the best example of an organ undergoing polyploidization.However,this happens
early in life and is not associated with functional decline or disease. As we have seen, liver
has the capacity to regenerate after hepatectomy; for example, after surgical removal of a
tumor. The rate of liver regeneration after hepatectomy declines in old animals, but the
regenerative capacity remains unchanged, given sufﬁcient time.
The best described functional change that occurs with age in the liver is the reduced
clearance of certain drugs and a marked increase in the frequency of adverse drug reac-
tions. This is illustrated by the results of an experiment conducted in my laboratory in
which young and old mice of two different strains were compared for their capacities to
repair DNA adducts induced by BaP. As described in the previous chapter, BaP needs to
undergo metabolic activation to yield more reactive forms that can then interact with
nucleophilic centers in DNA. Using the 32P-postlabeling assay we determined the levels of
the main adduct in different organs of these mice. The results394 indicated that the maxi-
mum formation of this adduct was more than 3-fold higher in young as compared to old
mice.This is likely to be due to decreased activation of BaP by enzymes of the cytochrome
P450 family in the old animals. Indeed, others have demonstrated that the total microso-
mal cytochrome P450 content is signiﬁcantly reduced in rodent liver at old age792. The
liver is therefore less able to help rid the body of drugs and other substances and the
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
255

effects of drugs, intended or unintended, last longer. It is unclear whether the age-related
accumulation of mutations or the observed epigenomic changes are causally related to
liver functional decline.
7.2.1.9 Kidney and urinary tract
As people age,the kidneys tend to become smaller.Similar to liver,this may be because the
number of cells decreases and there is less blood ﬂow. Beginning at about age 30, the kid-
neys begin to ﬁlter blood less well793. This is associated with glomerulosclerosis, or scar-
ring of the tiny blood vessels called glomeruli, interstitial ﬁbrosis, tubular atrophy,
vascular wall thickening, and declining numbers of glomeruli. This results in declining
glomerular ﬁltration rates and creatinine clearance. The kidneys may also excrete too
much water, making dehydration more likely. Moderate to severe renal failure occurs in
one-ﬁfth of the elderly population. However, to a large extent renal failure is facilitated by
complications resulting from other diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. As we
have seen, such interaction among different aging-related pathologies is the norm rather
than an exception.
As discussed in Chapter 6,mutations at the HPRT locus were found to accumulate with
age in renal tubular epithelial cells to a very high frequency626. These cells are metaboli-
cally active, consume large amounts of oxygen and perform a majority of the secretory
and resorptive work needed to process glomerular ﬁltrate. It is possible that this points
towards a role of somatic mutation accumulation in the loss of renal function and elevated
risk of malignancy during aging.
The urinary tract changes with age in several ways that may make controlling urination
more difﬁcult. Indeed, among people over 60 years old, 15–30% suffer from leakage of
urine.At old age,the bladder can hold less urine.As women age,the urethra (which carries
urine out of the body) shortens and its lining becomes thinner. The muscle that controls
the passage of urine through the urethra (the urinary sphincter) is less able to close tightly
and prevent leakage.These changes may result from the decrease in the estrogen level that
occurs with menopause and from muscle damage associated with childbirth.As men age,
the prostate gland tends to enlarge. In many men, it enlarges enough to partly block the
passage of urine. This often leads to hydronephrosis, accumulation of urine in the kidney
with the ultimate loss of renal function.
Hence, whereas in men lower-urinary-tract symptoms are most often attributed to pro-
static obstruction, in women hormonal abnormalities are often the cause. However, there
could also be a similar pathophysiology based on defects in the detrusor muscle,the smooth
muscle in the wall of the bladder that contracts the bladder and expels the urine.
Coordinated contraction and relaxation of the detrusor myocytes is required for normal
organ function and alterations in myocyte structure and function have been implicated in
the etiology of various diseases of the lower urinary tract. However, other factors that
256
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

can play a role in the voiding dysfunctions observed in the elderly include ﬁbrosis of the
detrusor muscle and consequent impairment of contractility, cross-linking of collagen and
elastin,and loss of acetylcholinesterase-positive nerves.Since urinary function is controlled
by the coordinated activity of the urinary tract and the brain, non-cell-autonomous age
changes as a potential cause of the dysfunctions cannot be ruled out.
7.2.1.10 The reproductive system
Adverse effects on the reproductive system are probably among the earliest components
of the aging phenome and mainly driven by changes in the neuroendocrine axis. The
effects of aging on the reproductive system are more obvious in women than in men. In
women, most of these effects are related to menopause, when the levels of circulating
female hormones (particularly estrogen) decrease, menstrual periods end permanently,
and pregnancy is no longer possible. The decrease in female hormone levels causes the
ovaries and uterus to shrink. There is often hyperplasia of thecal cells, specialized stromal
cells, in atrophic ovaries. The tissues of the vagina become thinner, drier, and less elastic.
The breasts become less ﬁrm and more ﬁbrous, and they tend to sag. Most men remain
fertile until death, even though testosterone levels decrease, resulting in fewer sperm and
a decreased sex drive. Most men can continue to have erections and reach orgasm
throughout life. However, erections may not last as long or may be slightly less rigid.
Erectile dysfunction (impotence) becomes more common as men age.
7.2.1.11 Neuroendocrine system
Already in Chapter 2 I discussed extensively how the neuroendocrine system,from nema-
todes to mice, exerts its effects on lifespan. Indeed, one can almost say that the aging
process is driven, at least in part, by neuroendocrine activity rather than by its decline
with age. Nevertheless, we have already noticed that hormonal decline is ubiquitous
during aging and can be a source of many degenerative cell and tissue changes.As people
age,the levels and activity of some hormones (in addition to sex hormones) decrease.For
example, the levels of circulating GH and IGF-I decrease, which may contribute to the
reduction of muscle mass with age. The level of aldosterone, a hormone produced by
the adrenal glands, also decreases. This decrease may contribute to the tendency of older
people to become dehydrated more easily.
7.2.1.12 Immune system
The immune system is probably the most extensively researched host-defense mecha-
nism in aging794. In his now classic book The Immunological Theory of Aging795, Roy
Walford (1924–2004), a pioneer in aging research, proposed that the normal process of
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
257

aging is caused by faulty immune processes. In general, older adults experience more
infections and a greater severity of infections than younger adults. Whereas other
responses to infection, such as the capacity to mount a fever, are also reduced in the eld-
erly, it is reasonable to suspect ﬁrst and foremost a decline in immune response. This is
especially true because vaccines do not work as well in older adults as they do in younger
individuals796. The immune system is a complex combination of organs, cells, and signal-
ing molecules that together make up our defense against invasion by bacteria, viruses,
fungi, parasites, toxins, and foreign bodies in general, such as tumor cells. It carries out
this protective action by distinguishing between self and non-self. However, increased
numbers of autoantibodies at old age suggest that this fundamental component of the
immune system is also compromised by the aging process.
There are two complementary forms of immunity: natural or innate immunity and
adaptive or acquired immunity. Natural immunity includes dendritic cells, which take
up, process, and present antigens to the CD4	 T-helper lymphocytes in the form of small
peptides complexed with their own class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
proteins. Whereas older people may have fewer dendritic cells, they generally retain their
capacity for presenting antigen. Another cell type active in natural immunity is the
macrophage. This cell type is specialized in phagocytosis and intracellular killing of
microorganisms, is cytotoxic to tumors, and is also an efﬁcient antigen-presenting cell.
On top of that, these cells produce signaling molecules—cytokines—which initiate the
acute-phase response, a form of defense during acute illnesses involving the increased
production of so-called acute-phase proteins. In elderly individuals, the rate of antigen
clearance by macrophages is decreased and the toxicity of these cells against tumor cells
is low.
A third cell type of the natural immune response is the natural killer (NK) cell.NK cells
can kill target cells spontaneously and they are involved in host resistance to various
tumors and infectious diseases. The number of NK cells appears to increase with age but
their activity decreases, making them less capable of destroying tumor cells797. The main
soluble effector of natural immunity is the complex enzyme system in blood termed the
complement system. The system consists of interacting plasma proteins, which defend
against microorganisms through cytolysis and activation of inﬂammation. Complement
factors can also attach antigens to phagocytes, increasing the efﬁciency of the engulfment
of microbes. Like many components of the immune system, the complement system can
be responsible for unwanted physiological effects that increase during aging, such as
ongoing or chronic inﬂammation. This causes damage to the injured tissues and has long
been linked to rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but more recently also to other
aging-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis. In this
respect, it has been suggested that the reduction in lifetime exposure to infectious agents
has contributed to the decline in old-age mortality in the last two centuries798.
Adaptive immunity resides in the T and B lymphocytes, which are capable of speciﬁ-
cally attacking everything that is foreign,based on their recognition of all possible speciﬁc
258
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

antigens presented to them.As ﬁrst proposed by Frank Macfarlane Burnet799 (1899–1985)
and Niels Jerne (1911–1994)800,they can do that through a mechanism called clonal selec-
tion, which is eerily reminiscent of Darwinian selection. To summarize the situation, B
and T cells circulate around the body in great numbers of great diversity,distinguished by
various combinations of the DNA segments that make up their immunoglobulin or T-cell-
receptor genes, respectively.As already mentioned in Chapter 4, this variation is generated
through the process of V(D)J recombination, in which the DSB repair pathway of NHEJ
plays such an important role.The variation is such that all possible antigens can be recog-
nized. Indeed, after the initial clonal selection, subsequent somatic hypermutation serves
as a ﬁne-tuning mechanism to further optimize antibody–antigen binding801 (see also
Chapter 4).In species such as mice and humans,after selection B cells migrate to lymphoid
follicles. There, together with antigen-speciﬁc T cells and follicular dendritic cells, they
form germinal centers and start to replicate at considerable rates.Mutations are introduced
in the V regions of their receptors at a rate 105–106 times higher than the background DNA
mutation frequency.The resulting variants are selected on the basis of their afﬁnity for the
antigen presented by follicular dendritic cells and destined for the so-called memory
compartment. Such cells have a much higher afﬁnity for antigen than do germ-line cells.
The similarity of the entire process of selection and optimization of an immune response
to adaptive biological evolution is striking.
T cells are the most important cells in an immune response. Responsible for cellular
immunity, they originate in the thymus where they undergo selection to weed out those 
T cells expressing receptors that can recognize self antigens. The molecules responsible
for self recognition are the so-called MHC antigens,a highly polymorphic system respon-
sible for rejection of organ transplants. Only T cells that can recognize MHC molecules
complexed with foreign peptides are allowed to pass out of the thymus. Different T-cell
populations are distinguished on the basis of their expression of different types of CD
(cluster of differentiation) molecules.
Cytotoxic or killer T cells (CD8	) do their work by releasing lymphotoxins,which cause
cell lysis. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) serve as managers, directing the immune response.
They secrete the lymphokines, signaling molecules that can stimulate cytotoxic T cells
and B cells to grow and divide and enhance the ability of macrophages to destroy
microbes.The CD25	 CD4	 Tregs represent a unique population of lymphocytes capable
of powerfully suppressing immune responses. These T-cell populations actively control
the properties of other immune cells by suppressing their functional activity to prevent
autoimmunity and transplant rejection but also inﬂuence the immune response to aller-
gens as well as against tumor cells and pathogens. Also CD4	 helper T cells are necessary
for effective cell-mediated immunity, possibly mainly in the form of memory T cells,
programmed to recognize and respond to a speciﬁc pathogen once it has invaded and
been repelled. Thus, multiple, sometimes rare, cell types must communicate during 
cell-mediated immune responses and it is far from clear how such interactions are
orchestrated within organized lymphoid tissues802.
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
259

B cells control the humoral immunity. They are the antibody-producing cells and are
only stimulated to maturity when an antigen binds to its surface receptors in the presence
of a T-helper cell. Most of them then become plasma cells producing highly speciﬁc anti-
bodies. The other B cells become long-lived memory cells as described above.
Also for the adaptive immune response the overall number of lymphocytes is not
greatly affected in the elderly. There is some evidence that older human individuals have
signiﬁcantly lower absolute numbers of lymphocytes per volume of blood, but the
decline is not great and the individual variation very high803.Also in this case it is unlikely
that the age-related decline in immune response is caused by a lack of cells. Instead, it is
more the ratios of the different cell types that are affected and the way they react to an
infection. Perhaps the most important aging-related changes in adaptive immunity are
found in the T-cell compartments.The most visible sign of this is involution of the thymus,
the primary lymphoid organ in which bone-marrow-derived T-lymphocyte precursors
mature and differentiate into functional T lymphocytes804,805. Regression of the human
thymus starts after birth and continues at a constant rate until middle age. Because there
is very little effect of thymectomy in old age, thymic involution must be an evolutionary
adaptation, with the peripheral lymphoid organs taking over the role of the thymus.
However, alterations in T cells do appear to underlie aging-related functional decline of
the immune response.Both T-helper and cytotoxic functions decline with age.Aging also
leads to a dramatic increase in the proportion of antigen-experienced memory T lym-
phocytes with a concomitant decrease in naive T lymphocytes,thus lowering the ability to
respond to new antigens.
Aging-related changes in the B-cell compartments have also been observed. The
amount of antibody produced in response to foreign antigens decreases with age,possibly
due to a decrease in the number of circulating and antigen-responsive B lymphocytes. At
old age, B lymphocytes produce antibodies that bind antigens less well. In view of the
important role of T lymphocytes in regulating B lymphocytes it is possible that defects in
humoral immunity are really caused by changes in cellular immunity.
All together, there is sufﬁcient evidence to believe that adaptive immunity is seriously
affected by the aging process, probably more so than innate immunity. Naturally, it would
be extremely important to test the hypothesis that such a functional decline can ultimately
be traced back to a basic molecular cause, such as genome instability, in some or all of its
constituent cells. The enormous complexity of the different cellular interactions that con-
trol the immune response, especially adaptive immunity, make the unraveling of such a
cause-and-effect relationship a daunting task.In 1989 Claudio Franceschi (Bologna,Italy)
proposed a general theory suggesting that aging is indirectly controlled by a network of
cellular and molecular defense mechanisms (the network theory of aging)806.He proposed
that alterations in this network of cellular defense mechanisms could seriously disturb cell
physiology, with the neuroendocrine and the immune systems particularly affected since
they are themselves networks of interconnected cells, dependent on each other as well as
260
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

other factors.He argued that the two major challenges in testing this hypothesis would ﬁrst
be to understand how each component process affects function and viability of the net-
work as a whole and then to disentangle the interactions between different processes and
levels of functioning. I would add a third challenge and that is to systematically organize
the different activities of the components of the network and their changes with age in a
way that would allow us to identify the primary cause(s) of their decay and collapse with
age. Whereas we are currently far from knowing the molecular basis of aging-related
degenerative changes in this network of interactions, it certainly is not inconceivable that
they all ultimately derive from mutation accumulation, adversely affecting the signaling
cascades in these highly differentiated cells.
7.2.1.13 Summary and implications
The best way to summarize this brief overview of aging phenotypes other than cancer is
to say that age-related functional degeneration is evident at all levels.It is conceivable that
in most cases cellular changes are the ultimate cause of the degenerative phenotypes.
Hence, random genomic mutation could, directly or indirectly, be a primary cause of
many aging phenotypes. As we have seen, this possibility has been explored in only few
cases. Most work in this respect has been focused on studying mutation accumulation in
the mitochondrial genome, to a large extent because it is better experimentally accessible
than the nuclear genome. This is especially true when studying individual cells or small
cell populations. Hence, there is very little we can say at this point in time about genome
alterations in select cell subpopulations.
A major alternative causal factor appears to be protein cross-linking, which is impli-
cated in a number of commonly observed aging phenotypes, most notably aging of the
lens or collagen cross-linking of ligaments in the joints. Proteins are subject to a variety of
spontaneous degradation processes, including oxidation, glycation, deamidation, isomer-
ization, and racemization. These nonenzymatic modiﬁcations can produce functionally
damaged species that may reﬂect the action of aging at the molecular level.However,there
is no evidence that defects in protein repair, for example, the conversion of L-asparaginyl
and L-aspartyl degradation products by methyltransferases, cause accelerated aging807.
Likewise, mice lacking methionine sulfoxide reductase (which repairs oxidized methion-
ine residues) have a shorter lifespan and exhibit enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress808,
but do not show a pattern of premature aging symptoms so characteristic for the many
mouse models described in Chapter 5 with defects in genome maintenance.
There is some evidence in ﬂies that overexpression of the repair methyltransferases
leads to lifespan extension, but only at higher temperatures137. Similarly, overexpression
of the enzyme peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase A, which catalyzes the repair of
oxidized methionine in proteins by reducing methionine sulfoxide back to methionine,
also extends the lifespan of fruit ﬂies138. These transgenic animals were more resistant to
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
261

oxidative stress and the onset of both their age-related decline and their reproductive
capacity were markedly delayed.
Taken together, there is no strong evidence that protein damage is a major primary
cause of aging. However, current data are inconclusive and additional experiments are
needed to test causality. Meanwhile, it is impossible to rule out cellular and non-cellular
changes other than DNA or protein changes. Indeed, the accumulation in the germ line
through genetic drift of mutations with adverse effects at old age,as described in Chapter 2,
would predict a sheer inﬁnite number of autonomous forms of degeneration. It is obvi-
ous that there are many forms of age-related pathological lesion that are unlikely to be
caused directly by genome alterations.However,they can certainly be an indirect result of
such events, based on the aforementioned extensive networks of communication
between different cell types in the body. This makes it absolutely critical to further deﬁne
the aging phenome into a hierarchy of age changes,from primary to secondary and so on.
Genome-wide genetic-association studies of aging human populations are likely to play
an important role in this endeavor (see below).
As we have seen,in most tissues and organs cell loss does not appear as a major cause of
aging-related functional decline, although atrophy in key tissues cannot be ruled out as a
causal factor. Interestingly, hematopoietic stem cells in mice can outlive their original,
aged donor, as demonstrated by repeated serial transplantation in lethally irradiated
recipients809. What is changing in stem cells and most certainly in their differentiated
derivatives, is the quality of the function they provide. Indeed, depending on the mouse
strain, there is a limit to serial transplantations and functional decline in hematopoietic
stem cells has been documented732. Nothing is known about the possible intrinsic causes
of hematopoietic stem-cell aging or stem-cell aging in general. However, we have already
seen that neuronal stem cells accumulate genomic mutations during aging and there is
no reason why other stem-cell types would not display loss of genome integrity. Indeed,
evidence has been obtained for chromatin dysregulation during hematopoietic stem-cell
aging in the mouse (M. Goodell, personal communication) and for stabilization of the
chromatin structure through overexpression of a polycomb group protein (involved in
histone methylation and deacetylation; Chapter 3) preserving the replicative potential of
these cells (G.de Haan,personal communication).Could random genomic or epigenomic
alterations be a likely mechanism to explain aging-related deterioration of stem-cell
compartments?
As discussed in Chapter 4, stem cells appear to have generally lower spontaneous
mutation loads than non-stem cells, possibly due to increased sensitivity to apoptosis
and/or retention of the parental DNA strands in the stem cells after asymmetric cell divi-
sion.Apart from such aids in maintaining a pristine genome,stem cells have much better
opportunities to rid themselves from mutations (including epimutations) through
selection than differentiated cells. There is evidence from plants that stem cells with high
262
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

mutation loads can be purged from the population810, which may explain why such
organisms (similar to Hydra, the primitive metazoan mentioned in Chapter 2) generally
do not show signs of aging. Random mutations in stem cells would also not cause any
problem for the organism, as long as they do not affect the future functions the stem-cell
descendants need to carry out. However, adult stem cells are much closer to the differen-
tiated state and their plasticity is not entirely clear. This may explain why the stem cells
that occur in many tissues appear to show symptoms of aging-related degeneration.
While unknown at present, it is conceivable that at least some of this degeneration is due
to random genome alteration.
Finally, it is important to notice that in all cases the magnitude of the adverse effects of
aging appears to be surprisingly modest, at least in the absence of complications. The
most frequently occurring complications are those caused by disease, often a result of
unusual vulnerability due to environmental, lifestyle, or genetic factors. As discussed
above, it is very difﬁcult to distinguish disease from normal aging, except when the cause
of the disease is clearly unrelated to aging, as in certain heritable or environmental dis-
eases. An obvious example is lung cancer, which is rare during normal aging but very
frequent in smokers. The enormously increased risk of disease at older ages explains why
in early studies the effects of aging were often overestimated. Indeed, in the absence of
disease, there is often no good case for signiﬁcant adverse effects. This was the rationale
behind the SENIEUR protocol811.Originally this represented a set of inclusion criteria for
immunogerontological studies in humans to exclude as many endogenous and exoge-
nous inﬂuences on the immune system as possible and standardize the population under
study. Later, the protocol was adopted as a more general approach to separate pure aging
from those phenotypes related to exposure to environmental and disease factors. As later
realized,whereas it is useful to include the presence of disease in the interpretation of data
derived from an aging population,it is not possible to superimpose aging-related diseases
on a normal aging pattern that is nominally disease-free812. Rigorously applied, the
SENIEUR protocol would eventually exclude all subjects from population-based studies
on aging,because it is conceivable that natural death is always the result of disease-related
complications. We may not always be aware of it, because the cause of death in the oldest
old is often not known.Rather than adopting a model of disease-free elderly subjects,rep-
resenting the normal pattern that all old people would exhibit were it not for their ill-
nesses, it is more realistic to assume that different cell types and/or functional
sub-populations of cells age at different rates, with those aging the fastest and causing
problems (‘disease’) that ultimately lead to death. Genetic, environmental, and lifestyle
factors would then determine the aging phenotype and the cause of death. It is possible,
but far from proven, that the rate and type of genome alteration in these different cell
populations ultimately leads to the functional deterioration causing the problems and the
ultimate demise of the individual.

7.2.2 AGING IN OTHER SPECIES
As mentioned above, our knowledge of aging-related phenotypes in species other than
humans is limited. However, what is known about other mammals generally conﬁrms the
observations made in humans.This is not surprising because all mammals share immune,
endocrine, nervous, cardiovascular, skeletal, and other complex physiological systems. In
principle,they can all also develop the common diseases associated with such shared phys-
iology, including cancer, atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataract,
and many others. However, there are some notable differences between humans and other
mammals, including non-human primates. For example, whereas there are similarities in
the spectrum of vascular changes, such as increases in thickness of the intima media in the
carotid wall, rodents or non-human primates are highly resistant to atherosclerosis813. In
addition,whereas all mammals,to some extent,display age-related cognitive decline, brain
histopathological changes can differ substantially. Whereas mice (apart from transgenic
mice overexpressing mutant genes associated in humans with neurodegenerative diseases)
never show brain lesions such as senile plaques or neuroﬁbrillary tangles, aged dogs and
non-human primates do814. In these cases, however, the histopathology is not exactly the
same as in humans815. Aged dogs display diffuse amyloid in their brain, not the neuritic
plaques seen in humans.The situation for non-human primates is controversial and it is as
yet unclear whether such animals develop Alzheimer’s disease. Indeed, it is really only the
human species in which a broad scala of age-related neuropsychiatric illnesses is displayed.
The reason for this is unknown, but it may involve the long lifespan of humans permitting
these phenotypes to manifest. Finally, cancer is a major aging-related disease in all mam-
mals, with some distinct differences in tumor spectra.A curious exception seems to be the
naked mole rat, a long-lived mammal in which tumors have not as yet been observed816.
Overall, however, the aging phenome of all mammals is very similar. For invertebrates this
situation is distinctly different.
Two of the most popular animal model systems for aging are undoubtedly the nematode
worm C. elegans and the fruit ﬂy D. melanogaster. Nevertheless, we do not know a lot about
the aging phenome in these invertebrate animals. For nematodes, the most remote from
mammals of the two model species,some limited information is now available817,818.C. ele-
gans, which has a mean lifespan of 9–23 days (depending on the temperature819), is a self-
fertile hermaphrodite organism with a total of 959 somatic cells at maturity, all of known
ancestry.Aging of this organism generally results in substantially slower movement,a lower
pharyngeal pumping rate, accumulating lipofuscin, a ﬂaccid appearance, and a decline in
progeny production. Most of this can be readily observed through the dissecting micro-
scope. Using other microscopic techniques, including electron microscopy and ﬂuores-
cence microscopy to detect green ﬂuorescent protein as a transgene under control of
tissue-speciﬁc promoters, it has been possible to look at speciﬁc cell types such as neurons
264
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

and muscle cells in aging nematodes. The results indicate muscle deterioration resembling
human sarcopenia817. This may easily explain the locomotory impairment mentioned
above. Surprisingly, the nervous system appears to be remarkably preserved, at least in the
N2 strain, the only one examined thus far with such methods. Interestingly, these studies
revealed extensive variability in age-related degeneration,both among different,genetically
identical animals and among cells of the same type within individuals.This emphasizes the
potentially important role of stochastic effects in aging and I will come back to that below in
a model that could explain how accumulating informational randomization of the aging
somatic genome might be responsible for the aging phenome in different organisms.
D. melanogaster is closer to mammals than C. elegans. It was and still is the model system
of choice in genetics and has recently found a wealth of applications in studying complex
physiology. Several human disease models have been developed in Drosophila, particularly
for neurological diseases820.Drosophila is a popular model organism for studying the genet-
ics of aging for the same reason as C. elegans, because it is genetically tractable and has a
short lifespan. Genetic screens have also in the ﬂy allowed the identiﬁcation of single genes
that control lifespan (Chapter 2). Nevertheless, we know even less about aging phenotypes
in ﬂies than in nematodes, a notable exception being the heart. Drosophila has a circulation
and a tubular structure that contracts spontaneously to transport hemolymph, carrying
energy substrates from the abdomen to the thorax and head.Investigators found that maxi-
mal heart rate is signiﬁcantly and reproducibly reduced with aging in Drosophila,analogous
to observations in elderly humans821. In spite of such progress, the causes of spontaneous
death in ﬂies are as unclear as in nematodes.
What do we know about the possible molecular basis of aging in ﬂies and nematodes?
Is there any evidence that instability of the somatic genome plays a role in the cellular
degeneration and death that is also likely to underlie aging in invertebrates? One major
difference with vertebrate organisms is of course the lack of proliferative cell populations
in adult ﬂies and worms, in which cell division is conﬁned to the germ line. However,
while this may inﬂuence the spectrum of genome alterations,it is unlikely to suppress loss
of genome integrity. As we have shown, certain types of mutation can be efﬁciently
induced in non-dividing cells (see above and Fig. 7.5) and it is simply incorrect to assume
that mutation always depends on DNA replication.
In both C. elegans and D. melanogaster there is evidence for the accumulation of
mtDNA mutations, analogous to the situation in humans, non-human primates, and
rodents822,823. In Drosophila, the accumulation of deleted mtDNA appears to be tissue-
speciﬁc: occurring mainly in the thorax.Similar to the situation in mammals,it is unclear
whether such mtDNA mutations are a cause or an effect of aging in these animals.
Virtually nothing is known about nuclear-genome changes in either nematodes or ﬂies.
Results from Klass et al., in the early 1980s824, suggest that for nematodes there is some
evidence for an altered DNA template function at old age. More recently, progressive and
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
265

stochastic changes in nuclear architecture (e.g.nuclear lamina,chromatin) were observed
in most non-neuronal cell types of aging nematodes220, somewhat similar to the recently
observed age-related nuclear defects in human ﬁbroblasts219. Interestingly, as yet unpub-
lished work by Simon Melov (Novato,CA,USA) and colleagues provided the ﬁrst evidence
that large-scale instability of the nuclear genome is associated with increasing age in the
worm. Using a combination of real-time PCR (see below), in combination with morpho-
logical methods for visualizing DNA, these investigators found stochastic variability in
genome copy number with age within and among individual nematodes. Their results
indicate that genome copy number becomes dramatically deregulated with age,similar to
that seen with neoplasms arising with age in human beings. This molecular variability
appears to be tissue-speciﬁc, with most of it probably restricted to the reproductive tis-
sues.The changes observed appeared to involve mainly large-scale genome ampliﬁcation,
although at very old age deletions were also detected (S.Melov,personal communication).
Hence, it is unclear as yet whether aging in animals, vertebrates, or invertebrates is
caused by random genome alteration. This is different for another highly popular model
organism for studying aging: S. cerevisiae or baker’s yeast. This organism has proved to be
a great model for studying a variety of processes in higher organisms.While aging pheno-
types differ a lot more between yeast and mammals than between ﬂies and mammals or
even nematodes and mammals, there are a great many genes in these species that encode
very similar proteins825.Probably the best examples are the two close homologs (Ras1 and
Ras2) of the mammalian ras proto-oncogene, which are essential for yeast viability.
Expression of the mammalian H-ras sequence in a yeast strain lacking both ras genes
restores this viability, indicating conservation not only of sequence, but also of biological
function. Humans share 79, 39, 31, and 11% gene homologs with mice, fruit ﬂies, nema-
todes, and yeast, respectively (Table 3.1).As we have seen, this homology extends into the
realm of aging,with for example the sequence of the human WRN gene being highly sim-
ilar to that of the yeast SGS1 gene,which also encodes a DNA helicase.SGS1-mutant yeast
cells have a markedly reduced lifespan and share other cellular phenotypes with cells from
individuals with Werner’s syndrome826.There is a fair amount of evidence that the molec-
ular pathways that regulate longevity are partially conserved throughout evolution, rang-
ing from yeast to humans (see Chapter 2).
Aging in yeast can be studied as replicative aging or chronological aging.The former can
be studied by counting the number of daughter cells produced by individual mother cells,
whereas chronological aging is measured in non-dividing populations in water or minimal
medium. It is not clear if genome instability is the only cause of replicative or chronologi-
cal yeast aging, but there is certainly good evidence that it is at least one major cause. First,
replicative or mother-cell aging can be caused by the previously mentioned accumulation
of rDNA circles,which is a form of genome instability.As we have seen,this is controlled by
Sir2, the absence of which accelerates aging, while its overexpression extends lifespan in
yeast. (Overexpression of the Sir2 homolog in C. elegans also extends lifespan of this
266
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

animal153; see Chapter 2.) Independent of the rDNA circles, evidence has been provided
for increased LOH in yeast contributing to replicative aging in this species151. Expression
proﬁling of middle-aged mother cells revealed an apparent DNA-damage response827. For
yeast undergoing chronological aging recent results indicate mutation accumulation in
the reporter gene CAN1828. These mutations were decreased in long-lived sch9 mutants,
which is consistent with the idea that the accumulation of random mutations drives aging.
These results with yeast strongly suggest that genome instability is a major cause of
aging in this organism. Two factors were critically important for this conclusion to be
reached. First, its small genome greatly facilitates the detection of genomic instability,
either directly (the rDNA circles) or indirectly,using ready available marker systems,such
as, for example, marker genes affecting colony color or selectable reporter genes. Second,
yeast lends itself extremely well to genetic studies, allowing the comparison of lifespan
and genomic instability in a great many different genetic backgrounds in a very short
time. Before I discuss how we may be able to take conceptually very similar approaches in
mammals, including humans, it is necessary to address the question of how we should
envisage the translation of genomic instability, a stochastic process, into aging-related
cellular degeneration, neoplastic transformation, and death.
7.2.3 GENOME INSTABILITY: STOCHASTIC EFFECTS ON 
TRANSCRIPTION
For genome instability to underlie the relatively subtle changes in cellular function likely to
be causally related to aging-related degenerative phenotypes, an explanation must be
sought that obviates the argument that consistent functional decline cannot be due to
random genome alterations,such as DNA mutations,because the frequency of such events
is too low.As we have seen, the assumption that genome alterations are too rare to explain
aging is now essentially refuted by the abundant evidence for genome instability at all
levels at sometimes surprisingly high frequency. Nevertheless, it still remains obscure how
such random changes could adversely affect cellular function yielding aging phenotypes
that are consistent from individual to individual and often across different species.
We have already seen that in undifferentiated,proliferating cells random genome alter-
ations can be eliminated from the population if they adversely affect ﬁtness.In highly spe-
cialized cell populations this is generally much more difﬁcult,especially when the cells are
postmitotic. In such differentiated cells the only genes that are active, apart from house-
keeping genes, are those contributing to the particular function they need to carry out to
service the organism as a whole. Hence, genome alterations affecting this function will
immediately manifest as functional decline at the level of the organism. All cellular tasks
are carried out through networks, functionally connecting different genes and proteins
into modules.All genes in such networks as well as their regulatory regions are targets for
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
267

mutational alteration. The effect will vary depending on the level of redundancy in the
pathway and the type of mutational alteration. Because genome alterations are random,
the effect on each cell will be different, varying from no functional decline at all to a com-
plete ablation of function.For the organ or tissue as a whole the decline in function would
be the average of the effect on each cell in the tissue. This is schematically depicted in
Fig. 7.6. Of note, during development in as-yet-undifferentiated, proliferating cell popu-
lations, there will be continuous selection against mutations adversely affecting house-
keeping function, but probably not always against those negatively inﬂuencing the
specialized function these cells are destined to perform upon terminal differentiation.
Because mutation accumulation is not restricted to adulthood, in young adults organ
function will already be compromised to a varying extent and almost never maximized.
Indeed, although we demonstrated that certain types of mutations occur as readily in qui-
escent cells as in cells that are mitotically active (see above and Fig. 7.5), it is highly likely
that overall the mutation rate during development is high due to the large number of DNA
transactions that need to take place. This would be in keeping with the hypothesis of
Leonid Gavrilov and Natalia Gavrilova (both in Chicago, IL, USA) that early development
produces a high load of initial damage, which is comparable with the amount of damage
received during the remaining part of the life span829. This allowed them to explain the
Gompertz model of aging in terms of an exponentially increasing loss of functional redun-
dancy. Of note, such a model is in agreement with our own observations that already as
young adults mice suffer from a considerable somatic mutation load (Table 6.2).

Young tissue
Old tissue
Fig. 7.6 Age-related, cell functional divergence as a consequence of stochastic effects. Functional
decline is indicated by increasing darkness of shading. Even in a young tissue, the function of
highly differentiated cells in an organ or tissue is never maximized. The old tissue is different in
the sense that there are many more cells that have suffered functional decline, with some of them
dying (†) or eliminated (open space). Others have grown into hyperplastic or neoplastic lesions
(not shown) or have been replaced by ﬁbrosis (not shown).

The model for age-related functional decline in Fig. 7.6 is compatible with impaired
patterns of gene regulation as its proximal cause. Impaired gene regulation is a likely con-
sequence of genome alterations interfering with transcription, for example, methylation
changes or chromosomal deletions, resulting in haploinsufﬁciency, or translocations
altering the position of regulatory sequences relative to the transcription unit (Chapter 3).
If this is correct one would expect to see that aging is associated with increased transcrip-
tional noise, random molecular ﬂuctuations that create increased variability in the levels
of gene expression within a cell population.Transcriptional noise is to some extent inher-
ent in the basic process of transcription, especially for genes expressed at low levels830,831,
but could be greatly enhanced by increased mutational loads in the genome. As we have
seen in Chapter 3,gene expression is a complex process that involves chromatin remodel-
ing, transcription-factor binding, and initiation, elongation, processing, and export of
RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where mRNA molecules are translated into pro-
teins.Genome alterations could greatly increase stochastic variation in mRNA levels.This
has been demonstrated,for example,in cases of haploinsufﬁciency of transcription-factor
genes, which increases the probability of stochastic activation or inactivation of target
genes832. It is conceivable that random alterations in the somatic genome, for example, as
induced by ROS, contribute to increased stochasticity of gene expression.
To directly test for such increased transcriptional noise in aged tissue,Rumana Bahar,a
postdoctoral researcher in my laboratory, dissociated single cardiomyocytes from fresh
heart samples of young and old mice, followed by the quantitative analysis of mRNA lev-
els of a panel of housekeeping and heart-speciﬁc genes.Accurate quantiﬁcation of mRNA
levels in single cells requires the ampliﬁcation of the entire cell message, with each of the
different mRNAs ampliﬁed at the same level of efﬁciency. This should avoid loss of repre-
sentation; that is, the quantitative relationship between the expression level of the differ-
ent genes should be the same as in the original sample. A reliable protocol to this end has
been developed in the laboratory of our collaborator, Christoph Klein (Munich,
Germany)833. His method is based on PCR (Chapter 1) with a single poly-C primer, mak-
ing all ampliﬁed sequences equally GC-rich and allowing a high annealing temperature
(schematically depicted in Fig. 7.7).
We decided to use this poly-C-based ampliﬁcation method, but since it had never
been applied to cells taken directly from the in vivo situation, we designed a procedure to
test its reproducibility in maintaining correct representation of individual mRNA levels.
We repeatedly ampliﬁed the equivalent of a single cell from a pool of lysed cardiomy-
ocytes as compared with independent ampliﬁcations from single cells, all from the heart
of a 6-month-old mouse. We subsequently quantiﬁed for each cell or cell equivalent the
expression level of the heart-speciﬁc gene encoding the myosin ventricular regulatory
light chain (Myl2). This was done by real-time PCR, a variant of the PCR ampliﬁcation
method described in Chapter 1. Real-time PCR quantiﬁes the initial amount of the

template by monitoring amplicon production during each PCR cycle, hence the term
real time as opposed to the endpoint detection that is common in PCR. Products are
detected during the exponential phase of the reaction by using a dye that produces a ﬂuo-
rescent signal each time a double-stranded product is made. The more copies of the
template of interest present at the start of the reaction, the fewer ampliﬁcation cycles
needed to cross the detection threshold. Such CTvalues (a measure of the copy number of
the mRNA ampliﬁed) are used to calculate the quantity of the original template (Fig.7.8).
Since it is difﬁcult to obtain absolute values in this way,the results are always expressed as

Fig. 7.7 Schematic depiction of global mRNA ampliﬁcation using the method developed by
Christoph Klein833 and applied to cells directly taken from animal tissue. Critically important in
this method are the use of a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as a high-afﬁnity probe to bind the poly-A
tails of the mRNAs and immobilize them to small magnetic beads, and the single poly-C primer
for the PCR-based ampliﬁcation, which permits unbiased ampliﬁcation at high annealing temper-
atures (high speciﬁcity). The poly-T primer used for cDNA synthesis (the PNA probe cannot be
extended) is anchored immediately after the last A by using random bases (N  any possible
base; V  any possible base but T). Because poly-A tails are often very long, such anchoring
precludes the incorporation of large stretches of As in the ﬁnal PCR amplicons. The poly-C tail of
this primer in combination with the subsequent G tailing allows the use of the single poly-C
primer in PCR ampliﬁcation.

relative measures; that is, the expression level of the test gene relative to another refer-
ence gene in the same sample. Because in our situation any gene had the potential to
undergo random changes in its transcript level, we used different reference genes, rea-
soning that whereas this would not allow us to draw conclusions about absolute differ-
ences,our basic hypothesis of a signiﬁcant age-related increase in cell-to-cell variation in
gene expression remained perfectly testable.
In the example in Fig. 7.9, the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit
1 gene (mtCo1) was used as the reference gene. There was very small variation in the rela-
tive quantity of the Myl2 gene among single-cell equivalents, which was within the range
of experimental error when the real-time PCR was performed repeatedly on the same
template. By contrast, variation in expression of the Myl2 gene relative to that of mtCo1
among single cells was signiﬁcant. This result indicates that even among seemingly iden-
tical cells in the heart of a young mouse the Myl2 gene is not expressed to the same extent.
This was also proved to be true for other genes that are relatively highly expressed in heart
cells. For genes expressed at a low level the cell-to-cell variation was in the same range as
that in the single-cell-equivalent control. This is most likely due to the variation arising
from the stochastic distribution of low-copy-number template molecules, which limits
the accuracy of any ampliﬁcation system sensitive enough to amplify the total mRNA
content of a single cell.
To test whether our prediction of increased stochasticity of gene expression at old age
was correct, ﬁfteen heart cardiomyocytes were isolated from a similar area of ventricular

cell was subsequently subjected to the global mRNA ampliﬁcation procedure,after which
the expression level of each target gene was quantiﬁed using real-time PCR. For normal-
ization we used different genes in the panel, depending on the expression level. Rumana
subsequently quantiﬁed mRNA levels of 12 nuclear and three mitochondrial genes in
every one of the 15 cardiomyocytes isolated from each animal. The results indicated a
highly signiﬁcant increase in cell-to-cell variation in the expression levels of all nuclear
genes in the old animals as compared with the young ones. This increased cell-to-cell
variation was observed irrespective of the reference gene used. Examples of the increased

(Actc1), normalized over glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapd). Rumana
also quantiﬁed three mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase genes (mtCo1–3),
against each other as the reference gene (Fig. 7.10b). In these cases no signiﬁcant
cell-to-cell variation in gene expression was observed. This is not unexpected since these
genes are transcribed as one long RNA molecule, with a poly-A tail to guarantee its
capture in our ampliﬁcation assay (Chapter 3). Hence, relative to each other these mito-
chondrially encoded genes should be expressed at the same level in all cells. Indeed, even
if they would come from different transcripts, the large number of mitochondrial
genomes in each cell would always yield an average value that is likely to be similar from
cell to cell. Therefore, the absence of stochastic variation in transcript level for mitochon-
drially encoded genes independently conﬁrmed the unbiased nature and reproducibility
of the global mRNA ampliﬁcation method. Of note, the use of a nuclear gene as a refer-
ence gene immediately introduced signiﬁcant cell-to-cell variation in the relative quan-
tities of each mitochondrially encoded transcript.
Finally, to test whether the observed cell-to-cell variation in gene expression was com-
pletely random and not biased towards, for example, generally low gene-expression levels
in cells close to dying, heat plots were constructed for each group of cells; that is, from the
three young and three old animals. The results show no speciﬁc correlation of the relative
gene-expression levels for any of the cells, allowing us to conclude that the observed vari-
ation is random and free of systematic bias (Fig. 7.10c).
The results of these experiments established,at least for the heart,that the aging process is
associated with a signiﬁcant increase in stochasticity of gene expression.What is not known,
however, is whether this is due to random genome alterations or other factors. This issue is
far from resolved and much more experimentation is required. However, we did test

whether genotoxic exposure of cells, the ultimate source of most permanent genome alter-
ations, does lead to increased stochasticity of gene expression. For this purpose, Rumana
incubated cultured mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts from the lacZ-plasmid reporter mice
described in Chapter 6 for 2 hours in medium containing a low dose of hydrogen peroxide,
a known generator of oxidative damage.After washing the cells (which grow attached to the
culture plates),fresh medium was provided and the incubation continued.At different time
points thereafter, Rumana harvested single cells from the population, which she then
subjected to the global mRNA-ampliﬁcation procedure,similar to the cardiomyocytes from
old and young heart. In the ﬁbroblasts she assessed the mRNA levels of several housekeep-
ing genes, including the aforementioned Actb and B2m, with Gapd as the normalizer. As
compared with single-cell equivalents, untreated cells displayed a trend towards cell-to-cell
variation in gene expression,similar to the situation in cardiomyocytes from young animals,
albeit of lesser magnitude. At 48 h after the treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cell-to-cell
variation in gene expression greatly increased. This is shown in Fig. 7.11a for Actb as an
example,but a similar increase was observed for B2m and tubulin alpha (Tube 6).
To investigate when this hydrogen peroxide-induced transcriptional noise occurred
and how long it would last, we studied cell-to-cell variation in the expression of these
housekeeping genes at 6 h, 48 h, and 9 days after treatment in several independent exper-
iments. Cell-to-cell variation in gene-expression levels was plotted as the average coefﬁ-
cient of variation for the three genes from at least two independent experiments. As
shown in Fig. 7.11b, at 6 h after treatment, cell-to-cell variation in the relative expression
level of neither of these genes was increased. This strongly suggests that the increased
transcriptional noise induced by hydrogen peroxide is not due to direct chemical damage
to DNA, proteins, or lipids, the effects of which are likely to appear almost immediately.
At 48 h after treatment, there was signiﬁcantly increased stochastic variation, as men-
tioned above. This variation was still present 9 days after treatment (Fig. 7.11b).
A potential complicating factor in these experiments is the induction of replicative
senescence by hydrogen peroxide and other genotoxic agents in primary human or
mouse cells, as mentioned several times in this and previous chapters. At 48 h after treat-
ment and later, the cell populations started to show an increased number of senescent
cells, characterized by the ﬂattened and enlarged morphology typical for senescent
ﬁbroblasts irrespective of the species (Fig. 7.4). During this period, when the cells were
maintained in the same culture plates, survival after this low dose was high and cell death
not apparent.However,at 9 days after treatment almost all cells were senescent,as evident
from their ﬂattened and enlarged morphology. At that time, the increased cell-to-cell
variation in gene expression among the hydrogen peroxide-treated populations was still
highly signiﬁcant (Fig. 7.11b), suggesting that the senescent response has no inﬂuence on
the expression level of the three housekeeping genes studied.
Based on these results we concluded that hydrogen peroxide-induced transcriptional
noise is a relatively late event,which is virtually absent during the ﬁrst hours after treatment.

However, at least in a population of low cell turnover, the induced transcriptional noise is
also persistent. To demonstrate that such late-arising, persistent cell-to-cell variation in
gene expression induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment at least parallels the induction
of genomic mutations, we tested for the presence of mutations in the lacZ reporter gene.
The results of this analysis indicate that whereas some mutations were already present 6 h
after treatment,their frequency increased substantially at 48 h,and declined somewhat at
9 days. Most of these mutations were large genome rearrangements, as indicated by
restriction analysis of the mutant lacZ plasmids recovered from the cells (Fig. 7.11c).
Hence, the observed transcriptional noise appears to follow the kinetics of hydrogen
peroxide-induced mutations.
In view of the results described above834, we can merely speculate that the accumula-
tion of genome rearrangements may contribute to the increased stochasticity of gene
expression, for example, through gene-dose and/or position effects. This could be true
for both the hydrogen peroxide-treated cells and the aging mouse heart. Indeed, as
described in the previous chapter, genome rearrangements at the lacZ reporter locus
accumulate with age in the mouse heart. However, there are other types of genome
alteration that are relatively late events of DNA damage. Increased external noise in
transcription could be a consequence of random changes in DNA-methylation or his-
tone-modiﬁcation patterns,for example,due to incomplete restoration of these patterns
after DNA repair or replication. Like genome rearrangements, such epigenomic alter-
ations can be expected to modify transcriptional activity in a stochastic manner. While
random genomic alterations would be a logical explanation for the observed transcrip-
tional noise, we can at this stage not exclude other cellular changes unrelated to DNA
damage.
Stochastic changes in gene expression have been considered as a possible cause of aging
since Leslie Orgel proposed his error catastrophe theory (Chapter 1).After that, there has
been a shift in focus towards cell-signaling processes and various programmatic aspects
of aging. At present, the role of chance events is increasingly appreciated835, as also testi-
ﬁed by the work on nematode aging described above.Our present results do not allow any
further conclusions with respect to increased transcriptional noise as a mechanism of
aging. However, stochasticity is ubiquitous in biological systems and increased noise in
gene expression has been implicated in reduced organismal ﬁtness836. It is conceivable
that a variety of persistent forms of damage to biological macromolecules could initiate a
gradual increase in transcriptional noise introducing phenotypic variation among cells.
Such variation could generally become detrimental to normal cell functioning, which
would explain many etiological characteristics of the aging process, most notably its
highly variable, progressive decline in organ function. If a gradual loss of the informa-
tional integrity of the somatic genome is responsible for increased transcriptional noise
and a general deregulation of gene expression, how can we experimentally test whether
such events are causally related to aging?

7.3 Testing the role of genome instability in aging
To test for the possibility that aging is caused by a gradual loss of genome integrity it is not
enough to demonstrate an increasing load of genome alterations in aging cells and tissues
and correlate that with aging-related functional loss and disease. We have already seen
that even in the much simpler case of mtDNA mutations accumulating to a high level,
concomitant with abnormalities in the electron-transport system,it has not been possible
to distinguish between cause and effect (Chapter 6). Hence, further exploration of
increased genome instability in various tissues of mice or humans will contribute useful
new data sets and provide further insight into how increased mutation loads could be
causally related to aging, but will not allow any deﬁnite conclusions regarding a causal
relationship. For this purpose it will be necessary to design experimental interventions in
combination with genetic studies. Analogous to the situation in yeast—the organism for
which we have come very close in demonstrating that genome instability is a major cause
of aging—it should now be possible to design such studies in nematodes, ﬂies, mice, and
humans. Two lines of research can be distinguished: (1) genetic modeling of genome
instability and (2) population-based genetic studies.
7.3.1 GENETIC MODELING OF GENOME INSTABILITY
If loss of genome integrity is a major cause of aging, then it should be possible to engineer
accelerated aging in a model organism by increasing genotoxic stress.We have already seen
that a major reason for suspecting DNA mutations as a cause of aging was the discovery in
the late 1940s that low, daily doses of ionizing radiation accelerated symptoms of normal
aging in rodents505. However, the type of damage induced by radiation is unlikely to be
exactly the same as the spontaneous DNA damage inﬂicted during normal aging.An obvi-
ous way to enhance such natural damage is through the engineering of genetic defects in
genome maintenance.In Chapter 5 I described the genetic modeling of DNA-repair defects
in the mouse, based on the discovery that human segmental progeroid syndromes are
almost always caused by heritable defects in genome maintenance. Such modeling seemed
to have come tantalizingly close to a model of aging in which increased genotoxic stress
through the constitutive activation of major players in the DNA-damage response greatly
impaired cellular proliferation. This might especially affect stem-cell populations, prevent-
ing them from properly rejuvenating aged tissue, which would eventually lead to organ
dysfunction and degenerative disease. While a plausible scenario, I closed the chapter by
expressing some doubts about this model,based on the absence of any phenotypic evidence
that aging is caused by a lack of cells. Hematopoietic stem cells, for example, can outlive
their original donor upon repeated transplantation in lethally irradiated recipients for
several generations809 (see above). As mentioned, some do not consider such mice as good
278
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

models for normal aging in the ﬁrst place because they never display a full complement of
aging phenotypes; hence,the term segmental progeroid syndromes.As outlined in Chapter
5,I disagree with such a generalization,but it cannot be denied that in some of these mouse
models the symptoms of premature aging are of doubtful validity.
The strategy of modeling genome-maintenance defects in the mouse to test the
hypothesis that aging is due to genomic instability has at least three inherent limitations.
First, manipulating single genes almost always leads to unwanted side effects due to the
multiple roles most genes play in the physiology of an organism. An example is the Xpd
mouse mutant, which has defects in both DNA repair and transcription (Chapter 5). In
this mouse model it is not known whether the observed symptoms of premature aging
are due to the defect in repair or in transcription. Second, due to the several hundred
genes directly involved only in DNA repair it is not realistic to assume that one single gene
change is sufﬁcient to create an accelerated copy of the normal aging process. As we have
seen in the examples of the WRN and ATM genes, premature aging only becomes appar-
ent in combination with short telomeres. Since it is very difﬁcult to cross multiple traits
into a single mouse, the multigenic character of genome maintenance is a serious stum-
bling block in modeling aging through genetic manipulation at that level.Third,virtually
all mouse models of accelerated aging are based on genes that are entirely ablated or
severely impaired in their activity. A better approach would be to systematically replace
genome-maintenance genes by variants that are only slightly defective,possibly polymor-
phic gene variants found associated with aging-related phenotypes in human population
studies (see below).
One way to address some of the limitations of genetically manipulating genome main-
tenance in accelerating the normal aging process is to carefully select only those genome-
maintenance pathways most likely to affect aging. From Chapter 4, we were able to
conclude that DSB repair pathways could be among the ones most critical for aging.
Erroneous repair of such lesions could easily lead to large genome rearrangements,muta-
tional events most likely to severely impact patterns of normal gene regulation. In
Chapter 5 we have also seen that mice with defects in the key genes acting in this path-
way—Ku80 and Prkdc (DNA PKCS)—all show symptoms of accelerated aging and a
shorter lifespan. The Ku80-null mice, made by Paul Hasty458, which are the ones investi-
gated most thoroughly, show these phenotypes at similar points in their survival curves
and at the same level of severity as the normal control mice. The involvement of NHEJ in
V(D)J recombination may confound some of the results obtained; overall, however, this
mouse model appears to reﬂect the normal aging process more accurately than most
other models.
My laboratory, in collaboration with Paul Hasty’s laboratory, has now begun to study
genome instability in the Ku80-deﬁcient mouse model by crossing it with the lacZ-plasmid
reporter mice and then analyzing lacZ mutations in the hybrids and their littermate
controls. The ﬁrst results show a somewhat complicated picture. Very similar mutation
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
279

frequencies were observed in liver, signiﬁcantly increased mutation frequencies in spleen
(P  0.016) and signiﬁcantly reduced mutation frequencies in brain (P  0.013; Fig.7.12).
After characterizing the mutations it appeared that while in liver the total mutation fre-
quencies were the same as in the control mice, the Ku80-null mice showed a signiﬁcantly
higher number of genome rearrangements and a signiﬁcantly lower number of point muta-
tions. In spleen, the higher mutation frequency was due to a signiﬁcantly higher frequency
of genome rearrangements in the Ku80-null mice. In spleen there was also a trend toward a
lower frequency of point mutations. Finally, in brain the lower mutation frequency in the
Ku80-null mice was entirely due to a signiﬁcant reduction of the number of point
mutations. In brain, of course, almost all spontaneous mutations are point mutations
(Chapter 6).
We hypothesize that these results reﬂect a tendency for increased errors in the repair of
DNA DSBs in the Ku80-null mice. This conﬁrms earlier observations by others of
increased chromosomal aberrations in ﬁbroblasts of these mice350. The reduction in point
mutations, events typically associated with replication errors (see above and Fig. 7.5),
could reﬂect a reduced number of cell divisions in the Ku80-null mice.Indeed,these mice
are already very small at birth and it is possible that the increased member of DNA

double-strand breaks impairs cellular replication during development.A reduced number
of cellular replications would naturally limit the number of errors associated with such
replication (replication errors are likely to be independent of NHEJ) as compared with
normal mice.There is evidence for increased cellular senescence in primary ﬁbroblasts iso-
lated from Ku80-deﬁcient mouse embryos458. Because, as we have seen, unrepaired DNA
DSBs are associated with cellular senescence (as well as aging in vivo), increased genome
rearrangements could explain the premature aging phenotypes observed in this mouse.
The Ku80 story not only suggests that increased genome instability could very well be
the main cause of the observed premature aging symptoms in this mouse model, it also
underscores the importance of focusing on those genome-maintenance pathways likely to
be most critical as determinants of aging. Nevertheless, aging in Ku80-mutant mice is not
exactly the same as normal aging. Accelerating normal aging would require much more
subtle genetic modeling,for which currently the technological basis is not fully available.Is
it possible to model the downstream events that may underlie premature aging in the Ku80
mice and, possibly, normal aging? Assuming that large genome rearrangements are a
major cause of normal aging it may be possible to gradually increase the frequency of the
main lesion thought to underlie these events:DNA DSBs.Such an approach has been taken
for the mitochondrial genome.A mouse model was developed in which a mitochondrially
targeted restriction enzyme was expressed in skeletal muscle837. Such transgenic mice
quickly developed a mitochondrial myopathy, at 6 months, with large mtDNA deletions
present in muscle. In the absence of a lifespan study it is unknown whether the increased
DSBs gave rise to an accelerated-aging phenotype. However, as we have seen in Chapter 6,
transgenic mice expressing the gene twinkle—a nuclear-encoded mtDNA helicase with a
dominant mutation causing adult-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia in
humans—developed myopathy, but its effects were only mild and did not include symp-
toms of accelerated aging in spite of the demonstrated accumulation of deletions in the
mtDNA in tissues such as brain and muscle in these mice493. We have already seen that
proofreading-deﬁcient mice accumulate point mutations in the mtDNA much faster than
the control animals, which was found to be associated with premature aging, albeit most
likely a consequence of a DNA-damage response (Chapter 5). The results with twinkle,
therefore, indicate that mtDNA deletions either do not play a role in normal aging or need
to accumulate at a much higher rate to exert an effect. As yet a mouse model with an
increased rate of rearrangements in the nuclear genome based on a restriction enzyme
targeted to the nucleus has not been generated.
7.3.2 POPULATION-BASED GENETIC STUDIES
A second approach recently made possible by the surge in advanced genetic technologies
as a consequence of the Human Genome Project is direct association of the genes acting
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
281

in genome-maintenance pathways with aging-related phenotypes. In principle such an
approach can be applied to outbred populations of all species, but is most eminently
suitable for humans.The reasons are that,as mentioned,the aging phenome of humans is
the best characterized of all species and large ‘natural’populations of outbred individuals
that can be easily sampled and clinically evaluated are widely available.
There are two strategies to test the hypothesis that alleles at loci involved in genome
maintenance are associated with aging-related phenotypes838–840. First, in a so-called
global genome approach one would test the entire genome for regions that co-inherit
with one or more aging or longevity phenotypes.A second approach is a so-called candi-
date approach, in which only those genes known to be involved in genome maintenance
are tested. The former approach is the better one because it is an objective screen without
bias towards genome maintenance.
In the past, the identiﬁcation of genes, mutational variants of which were causing
disease, was cumbersome and only relatively straightforward in the case of monogenic
disorders. For monogenic disorders, such as cystic ﬁbrosis, there are often extensive pedi-
grees available in which co-segregation of a polymorphic DNA marker allele with the
disease-causing allele provided an indication as to the chromosomal location of the dis-
ease gene. This is called linkage analysis and requires a so-called linkage map of polymor-
phic markers. The higher the density of the map, the more precisely the location of the
disease gene can be mapped,albeit at a higher rate of false positives.Once the disease gene
has been mapped to a relatively small chromosomal region other methods, such as posi-
tional cloning, have been used effectively to identify the culprit gene on the basis of the
presence of a disease-causing mutation in the affected but not in the unaffected individu-
als. However, since the segment of the genome deﬁned by the marker alleles is still very
large—several millions of base pairs—even in this relatively simple approach the ﬁnal
identiﬁcation of the gene one is looking for is not simple.
The identiﬁcation of genes involved in complex phenotypes with late onset, such as
aging, is even more challenging. In such cases a standard linkage approach is essentially
constrained due to the need to collect DNA samples from families of affected individuals.
This is seldom a problem with disease phenotypes where onset is during childhood or
early adulthood but aging phenotypes arising later in life increase the likelihood that fam-
ily members will be deceased. Moreover, inherent complexity of phenotypes related to
aging suggests involvement of multiple genes with small effect and tight interaction with
environmental factors. The segments of the genome containing such genes are known as
quantitative trait loci (QTLs), regions containing genes that make a signiﬁcant contribu-
tion to the expression of a complex trait. It has proved notoriously difﬁcult to identify the
genes underlying a QTL, hence the low success rate of the linkage and positional-cloning
approach in ﬁnding genes involved in complex traits.
A conceptually much simpler approach to associating gene variants with phenotypes is
to directly compare the frequencies of variant alleles in a group of affected versus unrelated
282
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

non-affected individuals. Such association studies are essentially case-control studies.
Association-based studies are generally considered to be more effective tools for studying
complex traits because they have greater statistical power to detect genes of small effect.
There are two types of association study: direct association studies and indirect associa-
tion studies. Direct association studies rely on the aforementioned candidate genes,
selected because of a priori hypotheses about their role in the phenotype. If a positive
association is found,then the gene is immediately known and needs no further identiﬁca-
tion. At present, our knowledge about the putative functional relevance of candidate
genes and its potentially important interactions for a given phenotype is rarely sufﬁcient
to warrant direct association studies.
Indirect association studies rely on alleles of marker loci co-inherited with alleles at the
loci involved in the phenotype of interest. Indirect association analysis has recently
attracted a lot of attention because for the ﬁrst time this approach can now be taken
genome-wide, using markers that are evenly spaced throughout the genome without
regard for their function or context in a speciﬁc gene. As we have seen, a consensus
sequence for the entire human genome as well as for that of related species,such as mouse,
rat, and chimpanzee is now available. Although we have still not identiﬁed and annotated
all the genes in the human genome, we do have extensive maps of individual sequence
variation.As we have seen,most of the variation in our genome is due to single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). Such variants, either in protein-coding sequences or in gene-
regulatory regions,could be important determinants of complex traits such as aging.
Genome-wide association analysis may be within reach as a consequence of the com-
pletion of the HapMap project841. The International HapMap Project, brieﬂy mentioned
in Chapter 1, is an international collaborative effort to organize the SNPs in the human
genome in a so-called haplotype map. In this map groups of SNPs are organized on the
basis of linkage disequilibrium, a consequence of the fact that chromosomes do not pass
from each generation to the next as identical copies. When germ cells are being formed,
the chromosome pairs undergo recombination, resulting in a hybrid chromosome con-
taining pieces from both members of a chromosome pair.Over the course of many gener-
ations, repeated recombination events in an interbreeding population lead to extensive
shufﬂing of chromosomal segments, some of which are still shared by multiple individu-
als.These segments have not been broken up by recombination and are called haplotypes.
Alleles of SNPs in such haplotypes tend to be inherited together.
The HapMap project will deﬁne the haplotype block structure of the entire human
genome and ‘tag’ the common haplotypes by so-called haplotype-tagging SNPs. This
should organize the 10 million common SNPs in the human genome into a few hundred
thousand tag SNPs to represent common haplotypes. Hence, comparing a group of
people with a disease to a group without the disease for all the 500 000 or so tagging SNPs
should reveal the chromosome regions where the two groups differ in haplotype frequen-
cies. These areas might contain genes affecting the disease. Hence, rather than analyzing
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
283

each of the approx. 10 million SNP loci, analyzing about 500 000 tagging SNPs is enough
to spot all possible genetic differences between the affected and non-affected groups842.
Technically, we are now able to do whole-genome association studies according to the
HapMap principle, for example, using the microarray chips now offered by companies
like Affymetrix (www.affymetrix.com) or Illumina (www.illumina.com), containing
hundreds of thousands of probes for SNP markers. However, there are some doubts
whether the predictions made by the HapMap consortium are entirely correct843. It is
known that there are multiple chromosome regions where associations among SNPs due
to linkage disequilibrium are only weak or fall apart entirely. Ironically, this is true for the
human IGF-1 receptor gene,as part of the IGF-1 axis often implicated in aging and aging-
associated disease (Y. Suh, personal communication). In such cases it will be necessary to
either score all SNPs in the region or potentially miss important information. The
HapMap strategy is also based on the assumption that complex diseases are mainly
affected by common SNPs. This is called the common disease/common variant (CDCV)
hypothesis, which is conveniently based on the fact that all SNPs known were found by
comparing only a limited number of unrelated individuals of few ethnic groups.
However, this assumption is seriously disputed843. The fact that many monogenic disor-
ders are due to a heterogeneous collection of variants that are individually rare has drawn
attention to the importance of rare gene variants in common,complex traits.If combina-
tions of rare SNPs turn out to be mainly responsible for the genetic component of such
diseases it will be necessary to re-sequence each and every gene with all their regulatory
regions for each individual participating in a population study.As mentioned in Chapter 1,
such $1000 genome sequencing has been predicted to be a reality within 10 years844.
Based on the rapid progress in technology development we should know within a few
years if the predictions made by the HapMap consortium will be correct. If so, objective,
genome-wide association analysis will undoubtedly be carried out to identify genes
involved in aging phenotypes. If genome instability is a major cause of aging we should
expect to ﬁnd genome maintenance genes among the genes associated with aging pheno-
types. If the HapMap predictions are wrong and most aging and disease-related pheno-
types turn out to be characterized by a wide range of common and rare variants, each
with minimal individual attributable risk, we may need to proceed with re-sequencing
genes acting in candidate pathways (awaiting the $1000 genome). In that case, progress
will be slower and biased towards the hypothesis under study, but most deﬁnitely provid-
ing increased insight into genome maintenance as a possible determinant of aging.
Awaiting a likely future surge of information on the genes specifying aging and
longevity, what is the current state of the art? As we have seen, the genetics of aging has
been strongly dominated by gene variants conferring increased longevity on mainly
invertebrate organisms. However, as discussed in Chapter 2, as we have seen, many if not
all of these mutants are artifacts of laboratory conditions and would not survive in the
wild. It will be necessary to demonstrate that individual differences in aging and lifespan
284
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

can be explained by variation at such loci in the wild. Trudy Mackay (Raleigh, NC, USA)
and co-workers took a systematic approach to link candidate longevity genes to QTLs
that affect variation in longevity in Drosophila845. It is very difﬁcult to map QTLs to the
level of the individual gene, even for Drosophila. These workers therefore used quantita-
tive complementation tests to determine whether 16 candidate genes affecting Drosophila
longevity contributed to naturally segregating variation in lifespan. In quantitative com-
plementation tests inbred strains derived from a natural population are crossed to stocks
containing loss-of-function mutations or deletions removing the candidate genes, main-
tained over a so-called balancer chromosome (carrying inversions that suppress crossing-
over with the chromosome that carries the candidate gene mutation). Failure to
complement suggests a genetic interaction between the allele of the candidate gene and
the naturally occurring QTL and can be attributed to either allelism or epistasis. The
results of this study demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, that several candidate longevity
genes, including the insulin-like receptor locus and at least one gene involved in oxidative
stress response, exhibit genetic variation for lifespan in Drosophila. Candidate genes for
genome maintenance were not tested in this study. These results and those of others sug-
gest that quantitative complementation testing is a promising candidate approach in
studying the possible role of genome maintenance in determining lifespan. However, the
approach has also been criticized,mainly because it is likely to yield false-positive results846.
Systematic approaches have also been explored in mice to search for genes explaining
natural variation in lifespan. Richard Miller (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and collaborators
used a population of mice obtained by mating the offspring of a cross between two differ-
ent inbred mouse strains with the offspring of a cross between two other strains. Such a
four-way-cross mouse population resembles to some extent a human pedigree. Hence,
they can be subjected to linkage analysis using a relatively small number of genetic mark-
ers (typically fewer than 500). Using this approach QTLs were identiﬁed that modulate
longevity847. There is no evidence yet for the nature of the genetic inﬂuences identiﬁed
through this analysis. This is not surprising,because the size of the genetic intervals delin-
eated is still extremely large,at 23 cM.
What do we know about gene variants and aging in humans? In humans, the heritabil-
ity of lifespan is relatively minor848, but extreme longevity appears to have much stronger
heritability. Although the available records do not support biblical or folkloristic claims
of the existence of humans with abnormally high longevity, people now, more frequently
than in the past, live to be 100. Indeed, the oldest person thus far recorded is Jeanne
Calment,who was more than 122 years old when she died in 1997.Thomas Perls (Boston,
MA, USA) and co-workers originally found that the survival ratio for siblings of cente-
narians compared with siblings of 73-year-olds was about 4 for ages 80–94849. In a later
assessment involving 444 centenarian families, these investigators found that, compared
with the US 1900 cohort, male and female siblings of centenarians were at least 17 and
eight times as likely to attain age 100, respectively850. Similar ﬁndings of a much stronger
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME
285

familial basis of unusual longevity have been obtained by Kerber et al.,who demonstrated
an increased recurrence risk for siblings for surviving to extreme ages851, whereas
Gudmundsson et al.852 found that the ﬁrst-degree relatives of probands who live to an
extremely old age are twice as likely as controls to survive to the same age.Moreover,mul-
tiple investigators have observed moderate familial clustering for extreme longevity. For
example, the immediate ancestors of the aforementioned Jeanne Calment were shown to
have a 10-fold greater likelihood of living 80 years or more, compared with the control
ancestors of a reference family853. Are the genetic factors contributing to extreme
longevity involved in genome maintenance?
Because it is virtually impossible to obtain DNA samples of pedigrees to follow the
segregation of extreme longevity, sibling-pair analysis has been adopted as an alternative
in the study of such late-onset genetic traits. Results of a genome-wide sibling-pair study
of 308 persons belonging to 137 families with exceptional longevity indicated signiﬁcant
evidence for linkage with a locus on chromosome 4854. A subsequent haplotype-based
ﬁne mapping study of the interval identiﬁed a marker within microsomal transfer protein
(MTP), which is involved in lipoprotein synthesis, as the possible modiﬁer of human
lifespan855.These results were not replicated in other populatons of centenarians856,raising
the possibility that the ﬁnding was speciﬁc for that particular population or was a false-
positive result.
A role for lipoprotein genes in longevity would suggest that it is mainly a lower risk for
cardiovascular disease that determines the longevity phenotype in human natural popu-
lations. This would be in accordance with the demonstration of the importance of large
high- and low-density lipoprotein particles for exceptional longevity857. Small LDL parti-
cle size has been associated with cardiovascular risk and a possible explanation for the
long lives of centenarians could very well be their possession of heritable so-called ather-
osclerotic protective factors. Indeed, results published in the same paper indicated the
association of this lipoprotein phenotype of exceptional longevity with an increased fre-
quency of homozygosity of a common functional variant (I405V) in the gene for choles-
terol ester transfer protein (CETP), and decreased CETP levels. Moreover, these
investigators also found that homozygosity for the APOC3 -641C allele is associated with
a favorable lipoprotein proﬁle, cardiovascular health, insulin sensitivity, and longevity858.
These results are also in agreement with the previously reported decreased frequency of
the apoliprotein E-4 (APOE) allelic variant,conferring a high risk for both cardiovascular
and Alzheimer’s disease, in French centenarians, suggesting a decreased risk for these dis-
eases in individuals with exceptional longevity859.
While limited mainly to lipoprotein-related genes in candidate-gene studies, these
results strongly support the utility of centenarians as a model system in which to study the
genetics of longevity and aging in humans.One persistent problem in centenarian studies
is the lack of good controls. Nir Barzilai (New York, NY, USA) and collaborators realized
that family members of centenarians are likely to inherit genetic factors that modulate
286
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

aging processes and disease susceptibility. While also harboring many genes that are
unrelated to the longevity phenotype, such offspring can be expected to be enriched for
longevity genes. Comparing offspring of centenarians in a case-control study with their
spouses as the control group, these investigators found signiﬁcantly lower prevalence of
hypertension,diabetes,heart attacks,and strokes among the children of the centenarians860.
Based on these initial results of linkage and association analysis in the human system,
most of which are based on candidate-gene studies involving only very few genes and
virtually no regulatory regions, it is clear that no conclusions can be drawn regarding
genome maintenance as a possible causal factor in aging. However, the fact that these ﬁrst
studies identiﬁed genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism as genetic determinants of
extreme longevity suggests that genome instability may not be the main cause of age-related
mortality in humans.
7.3.3 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
In the 1970s, before very much was known about the regulation of cellular senescence,
several authors, most notably Alvaro Macieiro-Coelho (Versailles, France)861, proposed
that cellular aging and immortalization both depended on random reorganization of the
cell genome, as determined by chance, intrinsic properties of the cell and environmental
factors. Macieiro-Coelho argued that such random genomic alterations as genome
rearrangements, transpositions, amd methylation changes caused the loss of division
potential. However, some cells had a high chance to overcome this genome reorganiza-
tion and escape from senescence. He took the mouse genome as especially plastic, based
on the assessment of a number of variables,such as the rate of sister chromatid exchanges,
chromosomal aberrations, and aneuploidy. Whereas this high plasticity quickly leads to
immortalization, Macieiro-Coelho observed a stabilization of the genome thereafter. It is
now known that replicative senescence is a programmed cellular response against genomic
stress,rather than a result of genome alterations per se,but these observations are in strik-
ing agreement with what could very well be the major cause of aging.As we have seen,due
to natural limitations in somatic maintenance and repair, somatic-cell populations grad-
ually lose their orchestral nature and diverge into cellular mosaics, as is their fate as inter-
mediaries between two germ lines. The accumulation of variation in the somatic genome
is inherently stochastic, with genetic and environmental factors playing important roles
in modifying patterns of genomic instability in different individuals of a population.
There is abundant evidence that genomic alterations in somatic cells are diverse and
can occur at signiﬁcant rates, but exactly how such random events cause functional
decline and disease is not known.A random mutation can exert an effect by being ampli-
ﬁed. The best example is of course ampliﬁcation by clonal expansion and we have seen
that this is the most likely mechanism underlying the dramatic increase of cancer at old
FROM GENOME TO PHENOME

age.There are other forms of clonal expansion,such as developmental expansion when all
mitotic descendants of a mutated cell inherit the mutation, with its altered behavior.
Another example is the aforementioned atherosclerotic plaque formation which may
involve local hyperproliferation. The small sets of cells involved in such forms of ampliﬁ-
cation could easily inﬂuence distant cell populations, for example, by releasing factors
that induce cellular alterations. This could signiﬁcantly extend the reach of a clonal
expansion.
Somatic mutations contributing to disease, based on the ampliﬁcation of a mutation
normally associated with a heritable form of the disease, are now well documented862.
Such cases are called segmental. For example, a microdeletion in the heritable disease
gene, neuroﬁbromin, has been detected in ﬁbroblasts cultured from the cafe-au-lait
lesions in the affected segment of the body of a patient with segmental neuroﬁbromato-
sis863. The mutant allele was present in a mosaic pattern in the cafe-au-lait ﬁbroblasts
from the spot lesions, but was absent in ﬁbroblasts from normal skin or peripheral blood
lymphocytes. Whereas there are many other examples of such somatic mosaicism, their
contribution to normative aging is unclear at present.
Whereas clonal expansion and diffusion of released factors could very well play an
important role in translating random mutations into aging-related adverse effects
(including non-cancer phenotypes), stochastic alternatives should not be ignored.
Indeed, the alternative possibility, proposed in this chapter, of increased transcriptional
noise generating cell mosaics of functional decline in highly specialized cell populations,
could very well be more generally applicable as a cause of aging.
In this chapter I have provided the alternative, more general possibility that consistent
patterns of functional decline in highly specialized cell populations can be a result of
increased randomization of gene-regulatory patterns. Irrespective of the exact mecha-
nisms by which random somatic genome alterations act to cause aging and disease, the
important question to address is to what extent such events contribute to the causes of
aging. Although it is hard to see how genome alterations could underlie each and every
symptom of aging, the key issue is whether it is the ultimate limiting condition that we
have to consider in designing interventions to attenuate the adverse effects of aging.
Indeed, is it possible that random genome alteration essentially constrains attempts to
signiﬁcantly delay or even reverse aging? This is the topic of the ﬁnal chapter.
288

A genomic limit to life?
In previous chapters I have discussed the possibility that aging is a universal outcome of
the natural plasticity of the genome. Random alteration of genomes and the principle of
natural selection provided the creative impulse behind the emergence of robust living
systems,most of which are simple,unicellular organisms.It is only in the small fraction of
complex metazoan species, with the soma held captive by the germ line, that aging ﬁrst
became apparent.As we have seen in Chapter 6,most deleterious mutations are efﬁciently
purged from the germ line through selection during propagation of the germ cells,
embryogenesis, and early life, resulting in cell death, spontaneous abortion, still birth, or
early death of individuals, preventing them from reproducing. To some extent, stem cells
or progenitor cells should also be able to rid themselves from cells harboring mutations
with adverse effects. Highly specialized somatic cells, however, can be expected to ulti-
mately succumb to an ever-increasing mutation load.
A model, presented in the previous chapter tentatively explains how random mutations
can lead not only to cancer,but also to reduced function of the highly differentiated cells in
vertebrates.Aging would then be the result of the ultimate failure of genome maintenance
in preventing increased noise in the execution of various cellular programs due to accu-
mulating errors in the information content of the genome. This model remains untested
and it could be wrong. Instead, aging could be partially or wholly due to a combination of
other processes, most notably increased damage to cellular macromolecules, which may
not be restricted to DNA, and the responses to their adverse effects. This possibility has
been extensively discussed in previous chapters. Here I will discuss the consequences of a
scenario in which aging is predominantly a result of random,irreversible alterations in the
somatic genome, and how that would impact our prospects to intervene and possibly
retard or reverse aging-related cellular degeneration and organismal death.
8.1 Aiming for immortality
The inevitability of aging and death has been a major theme in philosophy and literature
throughout the ages. It ﬁrst appeared in the oldest written story, the epic of Gilgamesh.
It was written in ancient Sumeria on 12 clay tablets in cuneiform script and tells the story
of Gilgamesh, the historical King of Uruk, somewhere between 2750 and 2500 BCE. The

central theme of the epic is the vanity of all human effort to escape death. Although
Gilgamesh ultimately realizes that the best way mortals can achieve immortality is
through lasting works of civilization and culture, eternal life would remain on the front
burner of human interest. One could argue that all world religions ultimately sprang
from the desire for immortality and that science,itself a religious offshoot,was born from
early practitioners of alchemy and hermetics and their attempts to ﬁnd the elixir of youth
when not occupied by seeking the philosophers’ stone to change base metals into gold.
Nowadays, such endeavors are considered as pseudoscience and serious scientists try to
stay as far away from such activities as possible.
Nevertheless, anti-aging movements blossom as never before, due to the availability of
a multitude of possible treatments to delay the inevitable, including dietary supplements,
cosmetics, hormone therapy, and many other interventions that are not part of standard
medical care. Although they are often considered as pseudoscience, there is in fact legiti-
macy in such activities. This is apparent, for example, from the website of the American
Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M). While hyperbole is generally not spared in the
information provided by this organization,it does reﬂect the mainstream scientiﬁc litera-
ture. Its recommendations may be frequently ﬂawed and its predictions that an age-less
society is just around the corner not based on a correct interpretation of the facts, but the
organization is nevertheless a genuine product of modern science. For example, I have
not found any evidence that A4M supports the use of undeﬁned anti-aging potions,
concocted when the full moon is in Gemini. Indeed, while it is impossible to know if any
of the proposed treatments extend human lifespan (or have long-term, adverse side
effects, as suggested for growth-hormone treatment), for many of A4M’s recommenda-
tions (such as exercise) there is evidence that they improve health and well-being in old
age. At least some of the preventive measures advocated by A4M and others are likely to
retard damage accumulation, often considered as the basic cause of aging.
Ironically,some of the various statements by mainstream scientists,claiming that there
are no effective anti-aging measures at present and that human lifespan cannot be signiﬁ-
cantly extended, are hardly more rational than A4M’s advocacy of an imminent age-less
society. Although it is important to warn against the more outrageous, unsubstantiated
claims of some entrepreneurs promoting anti-aging products, there seems no reason to
be unduly pessimistic about our future prospects of enjoying an increasingly longer and
increasingly healthier lifespan.Predictions made by,for example,Olshansky and colleagues
in a 1990 paper864, that future declines in death rates would not reach the levels required
for life expectancy at birth in low-mortality populations to exceed 85 years,were based on
past trends and theoretical assumptions that have never been tested. In fact, as described
below, there is clear evidence for a continuing mortality decline of elderly populations in
developed countries. Arguments that even eliminating all aging-related causes of death
currently written on the death certiﬁcates of the elderly will not increase human life
expectancy by more than 15 years make little sense in the face of the fact that we are still
290
A GENOMIC LIMIT TO LIFE?

relatively ignorant about the causes of aging-related illnesses and their relationship to
basic processes of aging (Chapter 7). To assume that the molecular and cellular basis of
such processes is distinct from ‘aging-related causes of death’is at the very least premature.
Hence, we are confronted on the one hand by the optimistic statements of an overen-
thusiastic anti-aging movement,and on the other hand by those who maintain that under
no circumstances can processes of aging be modiﬁed to signiﬁcantly extend lifespan. On
the basis of the scientiﬁc evidence, neither conclusion seems totally secure. The state-
ments made by the anti-aging movement are the easiest to discard, in the sense that there
is simply no evidence that any of their advocated practices intervenes in basic processes of
aging. Conversely, the possibility that at least some of them actually do retard aging can
also not be completely excluded. The pessimists are more difﬁcult to deal with because
they often represent mainstream scientists, and their message to reject false claims of
entrepreneurs promoting products to slow or reverse aging is a sympathetic one.
Nevertheless, their assessment that future increases in lifespan are all but impossible is
overly pessimistic in view of the abundant evidence to the contrary, mostly obtained in
animal model systems. Recent developments provide some support for potential initia-
tives to extend human lifespan.There are at least two bodies of knowledge that suggest that
lifespan is ﬂexible and can range far above the natural average under certain conditions.
The ﬁrst line of evidence stems from studies of animal and human populations. As we
have seen in Chapter 2, mortality increases exponentially with age, as originally estab-
lished by Benjamin Gompertz for humans in the early nineteenth century.While valid for
a great variety of species,it has never been clear if this exponential rise in mortality would
continue at much older ages.We have already concluded that in natural populations older
cohorts are rarely expected due to extrinsic mortality. A group of researchers has now
studied mortality at advanced ages for a number of species under protected conditions,
including ﬂies, worms, and humans. Especially the data on ﬂies, from James Carey’s
(Davis, CA, USA)865 and James Curtsinger’s (St. Paul, MN, USA)866 laboratories, some
based on studying over 1 million individuals, indicate that mortality decelerates at older
ages and that many individual ﬂies live much longer than what was assumed to be their
maximum lifespan. Similar ﬁndings were made in the nematode worm in Thomas
Johnson’s laboratory867. In humans, work by James Vaupel (Rostock, Germany)56 and
others,based on 70 million elderly people,suggests that mortality decelerates after age 80,
reaching perhaps a maximum around age 110. Superﬁcially these results appear to refute
the evolutionary basis of aging which predicts that mortality should continue to increase
ever more rapidly after the reproductive period. However, populations are never homog-
enous, even if they are inbred, and it is likely that the results of these studies simply reﬂect
genetic good fortune, chance, and environmental permissiveness. Moreover, in the
absence of speciﬁc quantitative predictions of the evolutionary theory of aging with
respect to extreme old age it is premature to conclude that a deceleration of the increase in
mortality with age is not in keeping with its basic tenets.
A GENOMIC LIMIT TO LIFE?
291

Human life expectancies are increasing almost everywhere in the world where
socioeconomic circumstances are permissive3,868 and there is no evidence that a limit
to life is anywhere near1,869. This increase in lifespan effectively rules out a compression
of morbidity as proposed by James Fries (Palo Alto, CA, USA)870. According to this
hypothesis, we can expect to reduce morbidity and delay the onset of chronic disease.
Mortality, however, was assumed to be unalterable and ﬁxed according to the species’
genetic make-up. While reducing morbidity should of course always be a major goal in
aging research and, as we have seen, the dramatic improvements in general nutrition,
hygiene and public safety have indeed been responsible for a rectangularization of our
survival curve, the evidence is lacking that it is possible to continue along this track.
Indeed, it is highly doubtful whether we will be able to eliminate aging-related diseases
without substantially increasing maximum lifespan. In view of the absence of any scien-
tiﬁc criteria to separate such diseases from an hypothetical intrinsic aging process (see
Chapter 7) we have to assume that a successful delay of chronic disease will automatically
increase lifespan. This is exactly what we are now witnessing2. Older individuals have
never been so healthy and further improvements in life style, environmental conditions,
and medical care, on a sound scientiﬁc basis, are likely to help this trend to continue. It
will obviously take decades before we will know the effect of such recent medical advances
as the large-scale use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Nevertheless,
all available evidence points towards a continuing rise in both human health and lifespan.
A second line of evidence supporting the plasticity of animal lifespan and the potential
for intervention is provided by the discovery that intervention in growth,energy metabo-
lism, reproduction, or nutrient sensing can greatly increase longevity in a range of model
organisms, from worms and ﬂies to mice871.As extensively discussed in Chapter 2, damp-
ening such activities activates pathways that promote survival by regulating genes that
control cellular maintenance and repair. The realization that aging, like many other bio-
logical processes, is subject to regulation by pathways that have been conserved during
evolution suggests that it is also possible to intervene in its basic causes in humans.
Indeed,it was noted by Cynthia Kenyon that the 6-fold extension of lifespan in C. elegans,
achieved by removing the reproductive system and decreasing insulin-signaling activity
in the same animals, would be the equivalent of healthy, active 500-year-old humans871.
Pharmacological simulation of these effects may therefore prolong life and youthful
vigor. This approach has been discussed by Richard Miller, who concluded that the exis-
tence of long-lived mutants in a variety of species together with an expected enormously
increased knowledge about aging were a strong basis for predicting a lifespan increase of
up to 40% in humans872. However, as we have seen, intervention in metabolism carries a
price and it remains to be seen whether compounds can be identiﬁed that mimic the
effect of, for example, calorie restriction, without adverse effects. In addition, since the
pro-longevity effects of intervention in these pathways on invertebrates are often dra-
matic (up to 4-fold), but much less in rodents (up to 50–60%), they may increase lifespan
292
A GENOMIC LIMIT TO LIFE?

of humans only marginally. Indeed, whereas the ﬁrst results of calorie restriction on 
non-human primates do indicate similar beneﬁcial effects on health and function as
in rodents, such as reduced body temperature and insulin levels, signiﬁcantly longer life-
spans are not yet apparent. Because these studies are still ongoing deﬁnite conclusions
cannot be drawn. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible that much smaller increases in life-
span in humans or rodents,percentage-wise,than in worms or ﬂies may be a consequence
of the increased complexity of pathways such as the insulin/IGF-1 pathway in long-lived
mammals. Of note is that these invertebrate organisms are composed entirely of postmi-
totic cells, whereas mammals have renewable tissues that need to be replenished by cell
proliferation. Nevertheless, the widespread existence in the animal world of the option to
increase lifespan through metabolic modulation is strong evidence that humans can also
be made to live longer, once a suitable strategy has been found.
8.2 SENS, and does it make sense?
We are now confronted with real scientiﬁc evidence that animal lifespan is malleable.
However, what evidence do we have that this malleability can be exploited to increase
human lifespan? Some time ago a group of scientists, spearheaded by Aubrey de Grey
(Cambridge,UK),proposed a different approach to slow or reverse aging873.Based on the
premise that aging is due to the accumulation of somatic damage they argue that inter-
vention can occur at three levels: metabolism,damage,and pathology.Metabolism gener-
ates damage, for example, oxidative damage, as an inevitable side effect. A fraction of
the damage cannot be removed by endogenous repair processes, which are necessarily
imperfect (Chapter 2), and thus accumulates. This accumulating damage ultimately
drives age-related degeneration and leads to pathology.
Interventions can be designed at all three stages. I have already discussed the option to
mimic the metabolic interventions that proved so successful in animal models, especially
invertebrates,to increase somatic maintenance and repair and decrease the accumulation
of unrepaired somatic damage. However, intervention at this level is likely to carry a
heavy price due to the extreme interconnectedness of metabolic pathways, optimized
over eons of natural selection. Similarly, intervention in pathology is necessarily imprac-
tical in the long term if the damage that drives it is accumulating unabated. Therefore, so
the argument goes, intervention to remove the accumulating damage is the most promis-
ing strategy to sever the link between metabolism and pathology and has the potential to
postpone aging indeﬁnitely.
Negligible senescence—the absence of a statistically detectable increase in mortality
rate with age—has been demonstrated to exist at least in one metazoan, Hydra874. Hydra,
a cnidarian, is one of the simplest of metazoans. It can reproduce vegetatively as well as
A GENOMIC LIMIT TO LIFE?
293

sexually and is basically a bag of stem cells, permeated throughout its body. This virtual
absence of a clear distinction between soma and germ line gives the organism almost
limitless power to regenerate. This, together with a lack of highly differentiated cells,
probably allows it to escape senescence. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 6, the growth
centers (meristems) of plants provide an unlimited source of ‘stem cells’ and a similar
open-ended lifespan as in Hydra. This does not mean that mutations do not accumulate
in such cells. However, in the absence of differentiated cells with highly specialized func-
tions, deleterious mutations can be efﬁciently purged from the population by intra-
organismal selection, whereas others might even be beneﬁcial and a source of adaptive
ﬁtness810.
Other multicellular organisms, especially certain poikilotherm (cold-blooded) verte-
brates, may exhibit negligible senescence but this has never been conﬁrmed in a statisti-
cally satisfactory way. No warm-blooded animal (homeotherm) has ever been shown to
do so. The strategies outlined by Aubrey de Grey and colleagues to emulate Hydra and
follow in the footsteps of Gilgamesh to stop aging in its tracks are termed strategies for
engineered negligible senescence or SENS for short.
SENS includes a number of interventions to reverse aging,ﬁrst and foremost clearance
of damage,including intra- and extracellular aggregates and macromolecular cross-links.
The focus here is on protein damage, not on DNA damage.A second type of intervention
prominent in SENS is stem-cell therapy to replenish tissues subject to cell loss.As we have
already seen, whereas cell loss may contribute to age-related functional decline, its share
in the causes of aging is likely to be small, except in disease states. Cancer is recognized as
a special problem due to its intrinsic genetic instability,facilitating resistance to any treat-
ment by activating or inactivating speciﬁc genes. In this case a rather drastic solution is
proposed involving the entire replacement of the body’s own stem cells by periodic
reseeding with telomere-elongation-incompetent stem cells. The lack of telomerase
would effectively prevent unlimited proliferation and therefore block tumor progression,
but would allow tissue replenishment for a given amount of time. The two ﬁnal compo-
nents involve the removal of senescent cells (which could be important in select tissues)
and the rescue of mitochondria from accumulating mutations by the transfer of their
genes to the nuclear genome.All these possible interventions have been described in more
or less detail in the scientiﬁc literature875.
Aubrey de Grey and colleagues have speculated that the advanced methodology to
repair each type of damage could become available in time to increase the expected age at
death of a healthy 55-year-old, which is currently about 85, to 115 by the year 2030. Since
the longest-lived person ever, Jeanne Calment, reached the age of 122 several years ago, a
target of 115 seems rather modest. However, it should be realized that efforts to increase
the average lifespan in such a short time to even this age will only succeed by drastically
accelerating the current downward trend in mortality. Indeed, even optimistic predic-
tions of average lifespans of 95–100 would require a large deviation from past trends869.
294
A GENOMIC LIMIT TO LIFE?

Predictions of rapid increases in life expectancy to 115 therefore require rather drastic
interventions which are unlikely to be accomplished through further optimization of
lifestyle,the use of nutritional supplements,and more frequent applications of novel pre-
ventive drugs such as the aforementioned antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering
drugs.Instead,it will require preventive and/or therapeutic treatment inhibiting the basic
processes that underlie aging and its associated diseases. Hence, SENS relies on technol-
ogy not yet developed. Is this unrealistic?
Roadmaps towards a desirable goal in science are not new and are frequently applied.
They merely serve the purpose of an extended look at the future of a chosen ﬁeld of
enquiry to bridge the space between where we are and where we want to be. A roadmap is
not a crystal ball and the reality will deviate from expectations.It is also perfectly legitimate
to rely, in part, on new technology expected to be developed. An example of this is the
Human Genome Project, which was originally meant to rely heavily on technology that
still remained to be developed.In reality,the project was accomplished ahead of time solely
based on improvements to the existing Sanger sequencing technology (Chapter 1).
Another example is the so-called war on cancer,which has not been particularly successful
in terms of clinical signiﬁcance. However, it focused everybody’s attention on a major
problem and a desirable outcome and its advances have been enormous in terms of our
understanding of the biological basis of cancer; it is still likely that this will ultimately lead
to successful therapies. Likewise, our greatly increased knowledge of the possible causes of
aging and enormously improved tools for engineering cells and animals make it worth-
while to at least consider the possibility that current trends towards declining mortality
can be accelerated considerably.While the time frame for obtaining even modest results is
likely to be excessively optimistic (as it was with cancer), SENS certainly provides a wel-
come step towards formulating a rational goal for aging research.With respect to the SENS
agenda,therefore,neither the uncertainty of as-yet-undeveloped technology nor the spec-
ulative nature of the predicted time frame should necessarily be considered problematic.
What is important, however, is its feasibility, which depends on an accurate deﬁnition of
the problem.In other words,is SENS in keeping with what we now know about aging?
Unlike cancer, aging is not a clonal phenomenon, but reﬂects a divergence from a
common differentiated lineage towards a mosaic of cells,differing from each other in the
frequency and location of the scars of aging. The assumption of SENS is that the types of
damage are very similar in all cells of a given tissue and can be speciﬁcally targeted. For
example, intra- and extracellular aggregates are proposed to be removed through enzy-
matic digestion and phagocytosis, respectively, macromolecular cross-links will be
removed through cross-link breakers, senescent cells by driving them into apoptosis,
and mtDNA mutations by incorporating the critical parts of the mitochondrial genome
into the presumably much better defended nuclear genome. As mentioned, cancer cells
will be prevented from progressing into tumors by depriving all somatic cells of telom-
erase and tissues suffering from cell loss will be rejuvenated using stem cells. All these
A GENOMIC LIMIT TO LIFE?
295

damage-control measures together are expected to reverse the adverse effects of aging
and restore youthful vigor.
One could of course have some reasonable doubt about the speed with which such
therapies would become available, based on the rather disappointing track record of
successful medical interventions through the ages. Indeed, in spite of some major break-
throughs in health care, such as the development of antibiotics, successful interventions
in aging-related diseases have been few and it is not immediately clear why the translation
from newly discovered basic biological principles into clinically robust treatments would
suddenly dramatically accelerate. However, this is not a decisive objection against SENS,
because we have clearly made signiﬁcant progress in understanding the basic causes of
aging and recent progress in biomolecular engineering has been dramatic. Hence, the
possibility cannot be excluded that preventive and therapeutic interventions to cleanse
the human body of molecular and cellular damage will be successful on a very short
time frame. The question is whether the list of proposed causes of aging as provided by
SENS is complete.As argued by Huber Warner (St. Paul, MN, USA), it is not clear at pres-
ent if these proposed causal factors have an impact on longevity, even in an experimental
animal model876. Indeed, as mentioned throughout this book, it is uncertain whether
factors like cell loss, accumulating senescent cells, or various forms of chemical damage
are causes or consequences of the aging process.
If a signiﬁcant part of the adverse effects associated with aging is the consequence of
random alterations in the information content of the genome, corrective intervention
would be impossible, or at the very least subject to enormous complications. In contrast
to chemical or cellular damage, which share the basic features suitable for therapeutic
targeting, random genome alteration creates (epi)genetically different cells, a situation
that cannot be easily reversed. In the absence of turnover from an immutable template,
altered genomes can also not be liquidated as in protein repair. Hence, every individual
cell would now be genetically different and would need individual ‘treatment’ to correct
its mutation load. In principle, such correction would be very similar to current attempts
at gene therapy: through the use of vectors transferring the correct piece of DNA
sequence into the sick cell to replace the mutated fragment. Editing genes to correct
defects has made great strides, but it is unlikely that we will ever be able to correct the
collection of random mutations in our genome that result from natural wear and tear.
Indeed, it is entirely reasonable to assume that stochastic alterations in the information
content of the genome are essentially irreversible.If this proves to be the main underlying
cause of aging SENS would have a problem because its strategy ignores the need to correct
genomic errors as a potential source of cellular malfunction.
Intriguingly, the SENS program does include a strategy to neutralize the accumulation
of mutations in the mtDNA: this potential cause of aging is very difﬁcult to ignore given
the numerous observations of high levels of mutated mtDNA copies coinciding with
functionally defective cells at old age (see Chapter 6).The proposal to rescue mitochondria
from aging through this mechanism by copying the genes residing in these organelles to
296
A GENOMIC LIMIT TO LIFE?

the nuclear genome depends on the safety of that environment from genomic or epige-
nomic alteration. Although it is true that there is as yet no evidence that changes in the
information content of the nucleus reach levels high enough to cause cell-degenerative
effects,the results mentioned in the previous chapter shed some doubt on the assumption
that the nucleus provides the safe haven for genes and their correct expression anticipated
by SENS.
If aging is based on random genome alterations that are essentially irreversible because
they lack a common signature that could serve as therapeutic target, does this mean that
lifespan is ultimately limited? Direct reversal of informational errors is impossible, or at
least outside the realm of current or foreseeable technology, but we may consider the
option to greatly improve genome-maintenance systems. Because the highly complex,
interconnected DNA-repair systems do not lend themselves well to further optimization
(see Chapter 4), intervention at the level of DNA-damage signaling to increase apoptotic
responses appears a reasonable strategy. As we have seen from the work of Peter
Stambrook, increased apoptosis may very well be the main mechanism through which
the mouse ES cells are able to maintain the integrity of their genome so dramatically
better than normal mouse ﬁbroblasts (Chapter 4). Although excessive apoptosis is likely
to increase rather than mitigate age-related functional decline and pathology (due to cell
loss, which may not be a major problem during normal aging; see Chapter 5), a slight
increase may lead to a more rapid rate of cell replacement and an increased preservation
of organ function. Of note, slightly increased apoptosis rates have been found associated
with caloric restriction, a condition that extends lifespan407. This strategy would heavily
depend on regeneration as a mechanism to replace cells eliminated because of their heavy
load of genetic damage.While regeneration of the liver after partial hepatectomy has been
described in previous chapters, this is not a general characteristic of human tissues.
Nevertheless, the capacity to regenerate exists in a wide variety of species and may still be
in place in humans.Hence,as speculative as this is,the possibility cannot be excluded that
we will be able at some point in time to harness the power of regeneration to more rapidly
cleanse our organs and tissues from damaged cells.
Although further optimization of genome maintenance may be a logical and possibly
the only feasible strategy for SENS, a gradual loss of genome integrity is ultimately
unavoidable. Indeed, maximization of genome maintenance could cause severe meta-
bolic imbalances and may not be tolerated by the organism. A logical way out of this
dilemma would be to use stem cells to replace cells worn out by high mutation loads.This
strategy has its own potential limitations, which make it even more speculative than
increasing cell turnover and regeneration. Stem cells may only be able to undertake very
limited repairs of organs like liver and heart.Indeed,ﬁbrosis (scarring) may be a fall-back
mechanism put in place when the natural stem-cell capacities are exceeded. Moreover, in
spite of the more robust genome-maintenance systems in stem cells than in differentiated
cells, there is no evidence that stem-cell populations do not accumulate genomic or
epigenomic alterations. On the contrary, preserving the genetic integrity of human stem
A GENOMIC LIMIT TO LIFE?
297

cells is a major concern, as exempliﬁed by the reported increased frequency of karyotypic
abnormalities in human ES cell lines after extended passage in culture877. Whereas this
was found to be dependent on the way the cell lines were propagated—manually or by
bulk-passage methods—and therefore to some extent subject to control878,accumulation
of genomic mutations will hinder stem-cell therapy and a strong focus on designing novel
strategies to further stabilize genomes is critically important.
In spite of the above and the rather ﬁtful advances in tissue engineering and stem-cell
nuclear transfer of late, it is conceivable that major improvements over the next decades
will allow transplantation of immunologically matched organs grown from stem cells.
Some tissues, especially the brain and skeletal muscle, are clearly not amenable to whole-
sale replacement by transplantation,but may be amenable to slow and steady cell replace-
ment. Hence, cell replacement is an essential component of SENS-like roadmaps.
In spite of widespread skepticism from the scientiﬁc community, I ﬁnd it not unlikely
that the essence of the predictions made in SENS will prove to be correct. Indeed, it seems
reasonable that novel interventions will appear,including some of those outlined in SENS,
and that their application will signiﬁcantly extend human lifespan, possibly even beyond
the target of 115 years by the year 2030, as speculated by Aubrey de Grey. There certainly
are a host of proximal causes of aging that lend themselves well to intervention. Most of
these may have emerged, as dictated by the evolutionary logic of aging, during evolution
through genetic drift or as adverse by-products of genetic traits with a beneﬁcial effect
early in life (Chapter 2). This will give us a grace period, as it were, for intervention, which
we have already begun to explore. It is difﬁcult to know the length of this grace period, but
there can be no doubt that it will end when mutation loads become too heavy and cell
replacement is no longer enough to compensate for the functional losses. Irrespective of
our progress in developing new measures for prevention or therapy, genome instability
will be the ﬁnal curtain and the ultimate limit to life. Genomes cannot be cleansed of all
genetic damage,because it is their nature to change and undergo mutation.Indeed,to keep
genomes free of change would be to tamper with the logic of life itself.
In 1998, the controversial French novelist, Michel Houellebecq, published his nihilistic
classic, The Elementary Particles (Les Particules élémentaires; Flammarion, Paris, 1998), an
indictment of our individualistic (‘atomized’) society. In this novel, the brilliant scientist
Michel Djerzinski develops the theoretical basis for re-writing our genetic code into a
new form, no longer susceptible to mutation, with the capacity to replicate indeﬁnitely
without error. In the novel’s epilogue this rather undigested chunk of science is the basis
for the creation of a new species of genetically identical individuals of one sex without the
capacity to reproduce and no longer susceptible to aging or disease.While philosophically
this reﬂection on the rise of such a serene successor to humankind (with gratitude to the
French philosopher Michel Foucault) may meet approval,I think most of us would prefer
to live a bit shorter, with our imperfect selves and an aging genome.
